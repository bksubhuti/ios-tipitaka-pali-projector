'abbhantara jātaka':['The Sister Bimbādevī had suffered from flatulence, and was cured with mango-juice and sugar which Sāriputta had obtained from the king of Kosala, at Rāhula’s request. The king, having heard of Bimbādevī’s affliction, ordered that she should be continually supplied with mango-syrup. On being told of the incident, the Buddha revealed this story of the past to show that it was not the first time that Sāriputta had obtained mango-syrup for Bimbādevī.<br>The atītavatthu is about the chief queen of a king of Benares. Sakka, becoming nervous on account of the austerities of an ascetic, wishes to destroy him, and arouses in the queen a desire for a ”Midmost Mango” (Abbhantara-Amba). After prolonged search - during which the ascetic and his companions are driven from the royal park because they are reported to have eaten the mangoes there - a favourite parrot of the palace is commissioned to find the Midmost Mango. He goes to Himavā, and learns from the parrots of the seventh mountain range that the mango grows on a tree which belongs to Vessavana and which is most strictly guarded. He goes stealthily by night to the tree, but is caught by the guardian goblins, who decide to kill him. He tells them that he is delighted to die in the performance of his duty, and thereby wins their respect. Following their counsel, he seeks the assistance of an ascetic, Jotirasa, living in a hut called Kañcanapatti, to whom Vessavana sends a daily offering of four mangoes. The ascetic gives the parrot two mangoes, one for himself and one for the queen. J.ii.392-400.<br>Ananda was the parrot and Sāriputta Jotirasa.'],

'abhibhū':['1. Abhibhū.-Chief disciple of Sikhī Buddha (D.ii.9; J.i.41; Bu.xxi.20). In the Arunavatī Sutta it is said that he went with Sikhī to a Brahma-world and, at the Buddha’s request, preached a sermon to the accompaniment of great magical powers. He proved that by using just such speech as if he were preaching to a gathering of monks, he could, standing in the Brahma-world, make his voice heard by its thousand realms (S.i.154f). The verses spoken on this occasion are, in the Theragāthā, ascribed to Abhibhūta (v.1147-8).<br>In the Anguttara Nikāya (i.226f.; AA.i.436f ) we find Ananda asking the Buddha how far Abhibhū’s powers bore relation to those of a Buddha, and the Buddha replying that Abhibhū was a mere disciple, and proceeding to describe the immeasurable powers of the Tathāgata.<br>Abhibhū was a brahmin because we find him so addressed in the Arunavatī Sutta referred to above, but in the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.202) he is spoken of as a rājaputta.<br>In the Patisambhidhāmagga Commentary (488f ) his story is given as an example of vikubbana-iddhi whereby a person could make himself seen in many places at the same time. We are told that he developed nīlakasina, to attract to himself the attention of the world systems.<br>The Thera Adhopupphiya had been a hermit in Himavā during the time of Sikhī Buddha and had offered flowers to Abhibhū. Ap.i.128-9.<br>2. Abhibhū.-A class of devas belonging to the Arūpa-plane (M.i.1). They live in the same plane as the Vehapphalā. In the Mūlapariyāya Sutta the word is used to denote all the Asaññasattādevā.<br>Buddhaghosa explains the word by saying abhibhavī ti Abhibhū; kim abhibhavī ti ? cattāro khandhe, arūpino. They are beautiful and long-lived, and are therefore considered to be eternal and identical with Brahmā (MA.i.30).<br>In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.329) the Buddha claims to be Abhibhū (=the conqueror).<br>3. Abhibhū.-The name of a Bodhisatta who obtained vivarana under Gotama. He will become the sixth Buddha after Gotama. Anāgata Vamsa, p.37.<br>1.

When the Buddha came to the city during a tour, Abhibhūta heard him and invited him for a meal; he later entered the Order and became an arahant.<br>Three verses ascribed to Abhibhūta occur in the Theragāthā, uttered, it is said, when his kinsmen and retainers came to him lamenting that he had left them without a leader (Thag.vv.255-7; ThagA.i.372f). The second of these verses is elsewhere (S.i.156) attributed to Abhibhū, chief disciple of Sikhī Buddha. But in the Milindapañha (245), Nāgasena ascribes the second verse to the Buddha, and in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.121) the third verse also is ascribed to him. The second verse is also assigned to the Buddha in the Divyāvadāna (p.200), but elsewhere in the same books (p.569) it is said to have been uttered by devas.<br>In a former birth Abhibhūta had been a householder in the time of Vessabhū Buddha and became a believer in the Faith, to which he was led by his friends. When the Buddha died, the populace gathered together to obtain relics, but Abhibhūta, having quenched the pyre with fragrant water, was first able to take those which he desired (ThagA.i.372).<br>He is evidently to be identified with Citakanibbāpaka Thera of the Apadāna (ii.408).'],

In order to induce her to come to him, the Buddha directed Mahā Pajāpatī to see that all the nuns came for instruction. When Nandā’s turn came she sent another in her place. The Buddha refused to recognise the substitute, and Nandā was compelled to go herself. As she listened to the Buddha preaching, he, by his magic power, conjured up a beautiful woman and showed her becoming aged and fading, causing anguish to arise in Nandā’s heart. At the opportune moment, the Buddha drove home the truth of the impermanence of beauty. Meditating on this topic, she later became an arahant (ThigA.81f. ; SnA.i.241-2).<br>The two verses preached to her by the Buddha, which she made the subject of her meditations, are given in the Therīgāthā (vv.19, 20).<br>In the time of Vipassī Buddha, Nandā had been the daughter of a wealthy burgess in the Buddha’s native town of Bandhumatī. Having heard the Buddha preach she became his pious follower, and, at his death, made an offering of a golden umbrella decked with jewels to the shrine built over his ashes (Ap.ii.608).<br>The verses quoted in the Therīgāthā Commentary, as having been taken from the Apadāna, really belong to Mettā, and are found in the Apadāna (ii. 515) ascribed to Ekapindadāyikā.

It flowed through Kosala, and atSāvatthi an udumbara grove grew on its banks; it, could be seen from the terrace of Pasenadi’s palace (Vin.iv.111-12; SnA.i.19).<br>To the south of it was Manasākata, and on its southern bank was a mango grove where the Buddha sometimes resided (D.i.235-6). The Tevijja Sutta was preached here, and the Aciravatī is used in a simile to prove the futility of sacrifices and prayers: it is of no use standing on one bank of the river and calling to the other bank to come over.<br>In the river were many bathing places, in some of which courtesans bathed naked; the Bhikkhunīs did likewise until a rule was passed prohibiting it (Vin.i.293; iv.278). The Chabbaggiya nuns, however, continued to do so even afterwards (Vin.iv.259f).<br>The river was crossed in rafts (Vin.iii.63); it sometimes became so full (D.i.244-5; M.iii.117; J.iv.167) that disastrous floods occurred, in one of which Vidūdabha and his army were swept into the sea (DhA.i.360).<br>In sheltered spots monks and brahmins used to bathe (Vin.iv.161), and onceSāriputta himself bathed there (AA.i.315). The Sattarasa-vaggiya monks frequented the river for water-sports (Vin.iv.111-12).<br>Once the Buddha was told that the Pañcavaggiya monks were in the habit of seizing the cows that crossed the river (Vin.i.191).<br>The elder Sivalī stopped on the banks of the Aciravatī while on his way to the Himālaya with five hundred monks (AA.i.139).<br>In the time of Kassapa Buddha the river flowed round Sāvatthi and, at the eastern fort, flowed into a wide and deep lake on which separate bathing places were made for the king, the people, the Buddha and the Order respectively (MA.i.371).<br>The people on the banks were in the habit of casting nets for fish (UdA.366). Near the river was Dandakappa, a Kosalan village, and while staying there Ananda bathed in the river with many other monks (A.iii.402).<br>Two occasions are mentioned on which monks hit in the eye swans flying over the river (J.i.418 and ii.366. See also DhA.iv.5 and 8f). It was here thatPatācārā’s child was drowned (DhA.ii.264).<br>Kapila was born here as a golden fish as a result of his evil deeds (DhA.iv.41; see alsoKapila S). In theAvāriya Jātaka (DhA.i.63; also ii.60) the name is given as Aciravatī, and according to I Tsing (p.156) means the river of the Aji (dragon).<br>2. Aciravati.-A canal which ran westwards from the Mahāvāluka-gangā in Ceylon; from it flowed four other canals eastwards: the Sataruddhā, Nibbindā, Dhavalā and Sīdā. Cv.lxxix.51-3.'],

In the present age she was the daughter of a rich and distinguished citizen of Benares but, because of her former evil speech, became a prostitute in Rājagaha. Having heard the Buddha preach, she entered the Order of the bhikkhunis. Wishing to obtain the higher ordination from the Buddha, she set out for Sāvatthi, but was waylaid and stopped by libertines. So she sent a man to ask the Buddha’s advice and he permitted her to be ordained by a messenger (Thig.vv.25-6; ThigA.30ff.; Vin.ii.277; Ap. ii. 610-11). Her case established a precedent (Sp.i.242). Later she attained arahantship.<br>It has been suggested (VT.iii.360, n.3; and VT.ii.195-6, n.3) that her name ”half Kāsī” might mean that she charged five hundred pieces from her patrons. For, according to Buddhaghosa, Kāsī means one thousand, and anything worth one thousand is called kāsiya.<br>Another explanation is, however, given by Dhammapāla (ThigA.32). The revenue which accrued to the king for one day from Kāsī was a thousand. Addhakāsī’s patrons had to give a like sum to spend a night with her. This is referred to in one of the verses attributed to her in the Theragāthā (v.25). For this reason she was called Kāsī. But later, many men, not being able to afford a thousand, would pay half the amount and spend the day with her. As a result she became known as Addhakāsī.'],

'aggālava cetiya':['The chief shrine at āḷavī (SnA.i.344; SA.i.207) (hence probably the name), originally a pagan place of worship, but later converted into a Buddhist vihāra. The Buddha stopped here on many occasions during his wanderings, and this was the scene of several Vinaya rules, e.g. against monks digging the ground (Vin.iv.32) and cutting trees (Vin.iv.34), using unfiltered water for building purposes (Vin.iv.48), sleeping in the company of novices (Vin.iv.16), giving new buildings in hand (Vin.ii.172f).<br>The Chabbaggiyā are censured here for a nissaggiya offence (Vin.iii.224).

In the early years of Vangīsa’s novitiate he stayed at the shrine with his preceptor, and disaffection arose within him twice, once because of women, the second time because of his tutor’s solitary habits (S.i.185-6), and later, again, through pride in his own powers of improvisation (patibhāna) (S.i.187). Here, again, the Buddha utters the praises of Haṭṭhaka Alavaka, who visits him with a large following, whose fealty has been won (according to Haṭṭhaka) by observing the four characteristics of sympathy (saṅgahavatthūni) learnt from the Buddha (A.iv.216-20).<br>Many lay-women and nuns flocked there by day to hear the Buddha preach, but none were there when he preached in the evenings (J.i.160).

'aggi':['A deity (probably identical with the Vedic Agni), worship of whom brought, as reward, birth in the Brahma-world.

He returns to find that the ox has been eaten by hunters, only the tail, one leg and the skin being left. ”If thou, Aggi-Bhagavā, hast not the power to look after thine own, how canst thou guard me?” So saying, he quenches the fire with water and becomes an anchorite. In the verses of this context Aggi is addressed as Jātaveda.<br>In the Santhava Jātaka (J.ii.43-5), too, the Bodhisatta is a votary of the deity.

See also KS.i.209, n.4.<br>In the exegesis to the Bhuridatta Jātaka (J.vi.202), the deity is spoken of as Aggideva, and mention is made of an enquiry made of learned brahmins by a king, Mujalinda, as to the way to heaven.

TheBuddha, seeing his upanissaya, sentMoggallāna to convert him. Moggallāna went to Aggidatta’s hermitage, but being refused shelter there, vanquished, by a display of iddhi-power, a nāgarāja, Ahicchatta, who lived in the neighbourhood, and occupied the nāga’s abode. While Aggidatta and his followers stand awestruck at this event, the Buddha appears, and realising that the Buddha is even greater than Moggallāna, they pay homage to him.

Aggidatta.-A brahmin of Benares and father of the Bodhisatta, when the latter was born as Somadatta. The old man lived by ploughing, and one of his oxen having died, he decided, on the advice of his son, to ask the king for an ox. Somadatta, with great patience, trained him in all the formalities to be gone through in an appearance at court, but at the crucial moment when Aggidatta was making his petition to the king, he used the word ”take” where he meant to use ”give.” Somadatta’s presence of mind saved the situation (DhA.iii.124-5).

Thereupon the Buddha preaches to him the Vasala Sutta (or, as it is sometimes called. the Aggika Bhāradvāja Sutta), and wins him over to the faith (Sn.21-5).

'aggikkhandopama sutta':['Preached by the Buddha while touring in Kosala with a large concourse of monks, the sight of a blazing fire being made the occasion for the discourse.

It is said that while the sutta was being preached sixty monks vomited hot blood, sixty left the Order in diffidence and sixty others became arahants (A.iv.135).

Here residents from the city would visit him morning and evening with offerings. On the way they had to pass a field, which in their many journeying they trampled and damaged. The farmer tried in vain to prevent them. One day, in exasperation, when the Pacceka Buddha was away, the farmer burnt his bower, destroying everything in it. When he confessed his guilt the followers of the Pacceka Buddha beat him to death.

He had been a bandit in Kassapa Buddha’s time, and having been unintentionally offended by the treasurer Sumaṅgala, who had built a Gandhakuti for Kassapa, he sought to take revenge on him and to make him angry by committing various heinous crimes against him. But the latter showed no wrath, and once, after having given aims to the Buddha, he gave over the merit, so gained, to the bandit.

'ajapāla':['A banyan tree which is famous in Buddhist literature. It was inUruvelā, on the banks of theNerañjara, near the Bodhi tree, and a week after the Enlightenment the Buddha went there and spent a week cross-legged at the foot of the tree. There he met the Huhunkajātika Brahmin (Vin.i.2-3). Two weeks later he went there again from theRajāyatana (Vin.i.4). It was then that the Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and persuaded him to preach the doctrine, in spite of the difficulty of the task (Vin.i.5-7; in the eighth week after the Enlightenment, says Buddhaghosa, SA.i.152). This was immediately after the meal offered by Tapassu and Bhalluka, so says the Majjhima Atthakathā (i.385; J.i.81). When the Buddha wishes to have someone as his teacher, Sahampati appears again and suggests to him that the Dhamma be considered his teacher (A.ii.20f.; S.i.138f).<br>By Ajapāla-nigrodha it was, too, that, immediately after the Enlightenment,Mara tried to persuade the Buddha to die at once (D.ii.112). Several other conversations held here with Mara are recorded in the Samyutta (S.i.103f).<br>Here, also, the Buddha spent some time before the Enlightenment (D.ii.267), and it was here that Sujata offered him a meal of milk-rice (J.i.16, 69).<br>Here, in the fifth week after the Enlightenment, Mara’s daughters tried to tempt the Buddha (J.i.78, 469).’<br>Several etymologies are suggested for the name:<br>(a) in its shadow goatherds (ajapālā) rest; (b) old brahmins, incapable of reciting the Vedas, live here in dwellings protected by walls and ramparts (this derivation being as follows: na japantī ti =ajapā, mantānam anajjhāyakā=ajapā, ālenti arīyanti nivāsam etthāti=Ajapālo ti); (c) it shelters the goats that seek its shade at midday (UdA.51). The northern Buddhists say that the tree was planted by a shepherd boy, during the Bodhisatta’s six years’ penance, to shelter him (Beal, Romantic Legend of Buddha,192, 238; Mtu.iii.302).<br>The Brahmā Sutta (S.v.167) and theMagga Sutta (S.v.185), both on the four satipatthāna, and another Brahmā Sutta (S.v.232f) on the five indriyāni, were concerning thoughts that occurred to the Buddha on various occasions at the foot of this tree, when he sat there soon after the Enlightenment. On all these occasions Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and confirmed his thoughts. Several old brahmins, advanced in years, visited the Buddha during this period and questioned him as to whether it were true that he did not pay respect to age. To them he preached the four Thera-karanā dhamma. A.ii.22.'],

He saw the presentation of Jetavana and, impressed by the majesty of the Buddha, joined the Order and later became an arahant. But because of past misdeeds he remained unhonoured and unknown, and on this account was despised by worldly novices (Thag.129-30; ThagA.i.250f).<br>He is evidently to be identified with Ghatamandadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (ii.436).

As a result of this he enjoyed happiness in heaven for 60,000 kappas, and when he was born from Tusita in this Buddha-age there was a great light on the day of his birth.

'ajitakesakambala':['Head of one of the six heretical sects mentioned in the Pitakas as being contemporaneous with the Buddha. He is described as a Titthaka (heretical teacher), leader of a large following, virtuous and held in esteem by the people (S.i.68).<br>According to the Sāmaññaphala Sutta (D.i.55), where Ajātasattu describes a visit paid toAjita, he taught the doctrine of ”cutting off,” i.e. annihilation at death. He was a nihilist who believed in neither good nor evil. In Tibetan sources he is stated to have taught that all beings must dwell in Samsara for 84,000 mahākalpas before they come to an end; nothing can prevent that (Rockhill: 103-4). The answer Ajita gave to Ajātasattu is given elsewhere (E.g., S.iii.207; M.i.515) as being the view of a typical sophist. His name is often introduced into the stereotyped list of the six teachers even where the views they are alleged to have expressed do not coincide with those attributed to Ajita in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta. E.g., S.iv.398, where he is represented as talking about the rebirths of his adherents - he who denied rebirth. In A.i.286 he seems to have been confused with Makkhali Gosāla. He was called Kesakambali because he wore a blanket of human hair, which is described as being the most miserable garment. It was cold in cold weather, hot in the hot, evil-smelling and uncouth (DA.i.144; MA.i.422-3).<br>According to the Mahābodhi Jātaka the Buddha had already refuted Ajita’s view in previous births (J.v.246). Ajita was evidently much older in years than the Buddha, for we find Pasenadi, in the early years of his friendship with the Buddha, telling him that he was a young novice compared with Ajita. S.i.68.<br>In the Milinda-pañha the king says that he had visited a teacher named Ajitakesakambala. This cannot possibly refer to our Ajita; the reference is probably to a teacher belonging to the same school of thought (”There is neither fruit nor result of good or evil karma,” p.4. His views are given on p.25 without mention being made of his name. But see note 2 to the Mil. trans., p.8.).<br>References to ascetics wearing hair garments are found in several passages of the Pali canon.

The duration of life among these devas is 16,000 Kalpas (Kvu.207). Sometimes Anāgāmī are born among the Avihā devas and finish their existence, in a subsequent birth, among the Akanitthās. These are called ”Uddhamsotā.” (DhA.iii.289f.; see also S.v.201).<br>The Akaniṭṭha-bhavana is the upper limit of the rūpvacara-bhūmi (Ps.i.84); it is also spoken of as the highest point of the universe,Avīci being the lowest.

By virtue of his asceticism Sakka’s throne was heated, and Sakka (Anuruddha in a previous birth), having tested him, and being satisfied that worldly attainments were not his aim, granted him various boons, including one that Sakka should not visit him any more and disturb his asceticism!

'alambusā':['The nymph sent by Sakka to tempt the sage Isisinga, as related in the Alambusā Jātaka.<br>In the present age she was the wife of the monk with reference to whom the Alambusā Jātaka was related (J.v.152-61).<br>Her name appears in the Vimānavatthu (p.16, v.10.

'alandanāgarājamahesī':['The name occurs in the Samantapāsādikā (iii.680), in a discussion as to what is and what is not, kappiya for the monks. Monks should not accept or use a pond or any such thing, unless it has been properly gifted to them.<br>But if the real owners of the pond, etc., or their heirs, or, if no heirs exist, the chief of the district, having discovered that the pond was being used by monks, were to give it to the monks, then the gift becomes kappiya, ”as in the case of the bucket of water taken by the monk of Cittalapabbata and Alandanāgarājamahesī” - evidently meaning that the water was later given to the monk by the mahesī, thereby making it kappiya.'],

'āḷāra':['A landowner of Mithilā, described also as Videha and Videhiputta, an inhabitant of the Videha country (J.v.166, 167). While journeying on business, in a carriage, attended by five hundred wagons, he saw the Nāga king,Sankhapāla, being ill-treated by lewd men who had captured him and, feeling sorry for the Nāga, Alāra gave gifts to the men and their wives and thus obtained his release. Sankhapāla, thereupon, invited Alāra to the Nāga kingdom where, for a whole year, Alāra lived in all splendour.<br>Later, realising that the Nāga’s wonderful possessions were the fruit of good deeds done in the past, he became an ascetic in Himavā and afterwards took up his abode in the king’s park in Benares. The king, seeing him on his begging-rounds, was pleased with his deportment and invited him to the palace. There, at the king’s request, he told him the story of his encounter with Sankhapāla and his subsequent life and exhorted the king to do acts of piety.<br>Later he was born in the Brahma-world. See the Sankhapala Jātaka. (v.161ff.).<br>Alāra was a previous birth of Sāriputta (Ibid., 177). (Ālāra.)'],
'alāta':['A minister and general of Angati, King ofVideha. He is described as wise, smiling, a father of sons and full of experience. When Angati consulted his ministers as to ways and means of finding diversion for himself and his subjects, Alāta’s counsel was that they should set out to battle with a countless host of men. The suggestion of another minister, Vijaya, was that the king should visit some samana or brahmin, and this idea it was that won the king’s approval. Thereupon Alāta persuaded Angati to visit the ājīvika Guna of the Kassapa family, who evidently enjoyed Alāta’s patronage. When Guna preached his doctrine that good and evil actions were alike fruitless, he was supported by Alāta, who stated that in a previous birth he had been Pingala, a cowkilling huntsman in Benares, and that he had committed many sins for which, however, he had never suffered any evil consequences.<br>Later, Angati’s daughter Rujā explains that Alāta’s present prosperity is the result of certain past acts of righteousness and that time will eventually bring him suffering on account of his evil deeds. Alāta himself, she says, is not aware of this because he can remember only one previous birth, while she herself can recall seven. See theMahā Nārada-Kasappa Jātaka (J.vi.222ff).<br>Alāta was a previous birth of Devadatta (J.vi.255).<br>In the text he is sometimes (E.g., pp.221, 230) also called Alātaka, perhaps for the purposes of metre.'],
'alīnacitta':['King of Benares; one of the lives of the Bodhisatta. He was so-called (&quot;Win-heart&quot;) because he was born to win the hearts of the people. He was consecrated king at the age of seven. His story is related in the Alīnacitta Jātaka.'],
'alīnacitta jātaka':['Story of the Bodhisatta, when he was born as Alīnacitta, King ofBenares.<br>An elephant, while walking in the forest, trod on a splinter of acacia wood left there by carpenters while felling forest trees for wood for buildings in Benares. In great pain he came to the carpenters and lay down before them. They removed the splinter and owing to their treatment the wound healed. The elephant, in gratitude, spent the rest of his life working for them, and, before his death, he enlisted his son, white in colour, magnificent and high-bred, in their service. One day a half-dry cake of the young one’s dung was carried into the river by the flood (we are told that noble animals never dung or stale in water), and, floating down, stuck near the bathing place of the king’s elephants in Benares. The royal elephants, scenting the noble animal, refused to enter the water and fled. Having discovered the reason for their behaviour, the king decided to obtain the animal for himself, and going up-stream in a raft, he saw the carpenters and the white elephant working for them. The merchants agreed to give him to the king, but the elephant refused to move till the carpenters were adequately compensated. The animal was taken in procession to the city and with his help the king became supreme ruler over India.<br>In course of time the Queen Consort bore a son to the king, but the king died before his birth. The Kosala king thereupon laid siege to Benares, but desisted from attack for seven days, astrologers having predicted that at the end of that time the child would be born. The men of Benares had agreed to surrender unless the baby proved to be a boy. After seven days the queen bore a son named Alīnacitta, and the in habitants of Benares gave battle to the Kosala king. The queen, being told that they were in danger of defeat, dressed the baby and took him to the elephant for protection. The elephant had been kept in ignorance of the king’s death, lest he himself should die of a broken heart. But, on hearing the news, he sallied forth into battle and soon brought back the Kosala king as captive.<br>Alīnacitta became, in due course, king over the whole ofJambudīpa (J.ii.17-23). This story and that of the Samvara Jātaka were both related in connection with a monk who had become faint-hearted. For details seeSamvara. The elephant of the Jātaka was the faint-hearted monk and the father-elephant was Sāriputta.<br>This Jātaka also was related by the Buddha, with reference to the ElderRādha whom Sāriputta had taken under his special spiritual protection and guidance, in gratitude for a ladleful of food that Rādha, as layman, had once given him. The Buddha pointed out that this was not the first time that Sāriputta had shown his gratitude (DhA.ii.106).'],
'alīnasattu':['The Bodhisatta, born as son of Jayaddisa, King ofUttarapañcāla in Kampilla.<br>When the boy grew up, fully instructed in all the arts, his father made him Viceroy. Later, Jayaddisa’s life having become forfeit to the man-eating ogre (porisāda), Alīnasattu volunteered to offer himself in his father’s place. The ogre, impressed by the prince’s fearlessness and by the readiness with which he carried out his offer, refused to eat him and absolved him from his undertaking.<br>Alīnasattu preached to him the five moral laws and, having discovered that the ogre was really a human being, offered him the throne, which, however, the latter would not accept (J.v.22ff).<br>In lists of births in which the Bodhisatta is mentioned as having practised sīlapāramitā, the Alīnasattu Jātaka is mentioned (E.g., J.i.45) (Adīnasattu, Alīnasatta, ālīnasatta).'],
'allakappa':['1. Allakappa.-A country near Magadha. When the Bulis of Allakappa heard of the Buddha’s death, they sent messengers to the Mallas asking for a portion of the relics, claiming that they too, like the Buddha, were khattiyas. Having obtained them, they later built a thūpa over them (D.ii.166-7; Bv.xxviii.2).<br>Allakappa seems to have had a republican form of government, but its importance was not very great. According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.161), Allakappa was ten leagues in extent and its king was on intimate terms of friendship with the King of Vethadīpaka. They spent a great deal of their time together, so that the two countries must have been near each other.<br>2. Allakappa.-The King of Allakappa and friend of King Vethadīpaka. They both renounced their kingdoms and became ascetics in the Himālaya. At first they lived in the same hermitage, but later separated and lived apart, meeting once a fortnight, on fast-days.<br>Vethadīpaka died and was born a mighty king of devas. Soon after, when visiting Allakappa, he learned that the latter’s asceticism was being disturbed by wild elephants. Vethadīpaka gave him a lute with which to charm them, and spells whereby he might influence them. The lute had three strings; at the plucking of the first, the elephants ran away at once, of the second they ran away but looked back at each step, but when the third was plucked, the leader of the herd came and offered the player his back on which to sit.<br>Some time later, Allakappa met the Queen of Parantapa, King of Kosambi, with her son Udena, who had been born in the forest, the queen having been carried thither by a large bird of prey. Allakappa took them to the hermitage and looked after them, in ignorance of their high estate. He later lived with the queen as his wife. One day he perceived, by the occultation of Parantapa’s star, that the king was dead; he told this to the queen who then confessed her identity and that of Udena, the legitimate heir to the throne. Allakappa gave to Udena the magic lute and taught him the spells that by their power he might gain his heritage. See Udena.'],

Mahosadha went to her father’s house and plied his trade as a tailor, taking the opportunity of observing the girl’s behaviour. He tested her temper and her character in various ways, and being satisfied that she was altogether desirable, he married her with the approval of Queen Udumbarā. She became popular with everybody and was of great assistance to her husband in frustrating the attempts of his enemies to work him harm (J.vi.364-72, 392; the story appears also in Mtu.ii.83).<br>In the present age Amarā was the beautiful Bimbādevī (J.vi.478).<br>In the Milinda (pp.205ff ) the king mentions the story of Amarādevī having been left behind in the village while her husband was away on a journey, and of her resisting a temptation to be unfaithful to him. ”If that be true, how,” asks the king, ”could you justify the Buddha’s statement (*) that all women will go wrong, failing others, even with a cripple?” Nāgasena explains this by saying that Amarā did not sin because she had neither real secrecy nor opportunity nor the right-wooer!<br>(*) Incidentally, these words do not really belong to the Buddha.

'ambalaṭṭhika':['Preached by the Buddha at Ambalatthikā (near Veluvana) to Rāhula. It deals with falsehood. Like a minute drop of water is the recluse ship of those who shrink not from deliberate lying, it is thrown away, upset; it is empty and void. There is nothing evil they will not do, they run every risk, like an elephant who guards not his trunk. One should practise constant reflection, thereby abandoning all things conducive to woe, either to oneself or to others, and develop self-control and purity (M.i.414-20). Rāhula was evidently yet very young at the time of this sermon, for we find the Buddha making use of frequent similes, and pointing them out to him. According to the Cy., he was at the time only 7 years old (MA. ii. 636).<br>The Commentary says that it was preached because very young novices might be tempted to say things both proper and improper; they were likely to imagine things. This sutta is to warn Rāhula against the use of lies (MA.ii.635f.; AA.i.145; ii.547).<br>The Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta is among the portions of scripture mentioned in the Bhābrā Edict of Asoka as being essentially worthy of study by all monks (See Mookerji: Asoka, p.119) (v.l. Ambalatthiya°).'],
'ambalaṭṭhikā':['1. Ambalatthikā.-A royal park on the road betweenRājagaha and Nālandā. It contained a royal rest-house (rājāgāraka) in which theBuddha and members of the Order used to stay in the course of their journeying. It was on one such occasion that theBrahmajāla Sutta was preached (Vin.ii.287; D.i.1).<br>Buddhaghosa (DA.i.41-2) says that it was a shady and well-watered park, so called because of a mango sapling which stood by the gateway. It was surrounded and well guarded by a rampart, and its rest-house was adorned with paintings for the king’s amusement.<br>It was one of the spots in which the Buddha rested during his last tour, and we are told that while there he discoursed to a large number of monks (D.ii.81; he remained there one night, UdA.408). But the most famous of the Buddha’s sermons in Ambalatthikā seems to have been the Rāhulovāda Sutta named Ambalatthika-Rāhulovāda Sutta, because of its having been preached in the park (M.i.414ff). From the context it appears as though Ambalatthikā was within walking distance from the Kalandakanivāpa in Rājagaha.<br>But see below (4) for a more probable explanation.<br>2. Ambalatthikā.-A park in the brahmin village Khānumata. TheBuddha went there during one of his tours through Magadha. On this occasion was preached the Kūtadanta Sutta (D.i.127).<br>Buddhaghosa (DA.i.294) says the park was like the pleasance of the same name between Rājagaha and Nālandā.<br>3. Ambalatthikā.-There was a place of this name to the east of the Lohapāsāda in Anurādhapura. Once when the Dīghabhānaka Theras recited the Brahmajāla Sutta there, the earth trembled from the water upwards (DA.i.131).<br>On another occasion King Vasabha heard the Dīghabhānakas reciting the Mahāsudassana Sutta, and thinking that they were discussing what they had eaten and drunk, he approached closer to listen; when he discovered the truth he applauded the monks (DA.ii.635).<br>The place referred to here was probably not a park, but a building which formed part of the Lohapāsāda. In the Mahāvamsa account (Mhv.xxvii.11-20) of the building of the Lohapāsāda we are told that the plans were copied from the gem-palace of the goddess Bīranī. The central part of the palace was called the Ambalatthikapāsāda. ”It was visible from every side, bright, with pennons hung out.”<br>Dutthagāmāni probably included a similar central part in the Lohapāsāda. This view is strengthened by No. 4 below.<br>4. Ambalatthikā.-According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.635), the Ambalatthikā, in which the Rāhulovāda Sutta of that name was preached, was not a pleasance, but a pāsāda, a kind of meditation hall (padhānagharasankhepa) built in the outskirts of Veluvanavihāra for the use of those who desired solitude. It is said thatRāhula spent most of his time there, from the day of his ordination as a seven-year-old boy.'],

'ambapālivana':['The grove presented by Ambapālī to the Buddha and the Order. It was in Vesāli and was given to the Buddha during his last tour in that town, at the conclusion of the meal to which Ambapālī had invited him (Vin.i.231-3). But both the Buddha and the monks seem to have stayed there previously during their visits to Vesāli (thus according to D.ii.94 the Buddha was already in the grove before Ambapālī visited him; see also S.v.301, which must refer to an incident before the Buddha’s last tour, because Sāriputta was still alive).<br>The Buddha is stated to have preached three suttas in the grove, two of them being on the value of the satipatthānā (S.v.141ff). In the third sutta (A.iv.100-6) he dwells on the impermanence of all saṅkhāras and proceeds to describe the process by which the whole world will ultimately be destroyed by seven suns arising in the world and drying everything up. In this sutta appears also the story of the teacher Sunetta, who, even after becoming the Great Brahma, is yet subject to old age and death.<br>The Samyutta also records a conversation that took place between Anuruddha and Sāriputta during a stay in Ambapālivana (S.v.301).<br>The grove was planted with mangoes and was so called because it belonged to Ambapālī.

'ambapālī':['A courtesan of Vesāli.<br>She is said to have come spontaneously into being at Vesāli in the gardens of the king. The gardener found her at the foot of a mango tree - hence her name - and brought her to the city. She grew up so full of beauty and of grace that many young princes vied with each other for the honour of her hand. Finally, in order to end their strife, they appointed her courtesan. Later she became a devout follower of the Buddha, and building a vihāra in her own garden, gave it to him and the Order. This was during the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli shortly before his death. It is said that when Ambapālī heard of the Buddha’s visit to Kotigāma near Vesāli she and her retinue drove out of the city in magnificent chariots to meet him, and, after hearing a discourse, invited him and the monks to a meal the next day. The Buddha accepted this invitation and had, as a result, to refuse that of the Licchavis of Vesāli.<br>While returning from her visit to the Buddha, Ambapālī was so elated at the idea of having the Buddha to a meal the next day, that she refused to make way for the Licchavi princes who were on their way to the Buddha. She refused to give up her invitation for anything in the world. The DA. says that just before Ambapālī’s visit to him, the Buddha admonished the monks to be steadfast and mindful, lest they should lose their heads about her (DA.ii.545).<br>It was after this meal that Ambapālī gave over her park, the Ambapālivana, to the Buddha and the Order. The Buddha accepted the gift and stayed there some time before going on to Beluva. Vin.i.231-3; D.ii.95-8; the two accounts vary in details, e.g. in the Digha version the Buddha was already in Ambapālivana, and not in Kotigāma, when the courtesan visited him.<br>Ambapālī had a son, Vimala-Kondañña, who was an eminent Elder. Having heard him preach one day, she renounced the world and, working for insight by studying the law of impermanence as illustrated in her own ageing body, she attained arahantship (ThigA.206-7).<br>Nineteen verses ascribed to her are found in the Therīgāthā (252-70).<br>In the time of Sikhī Buddha she had entered the Order. While yet a novice, she took part in a procession of Bhikkhunīs, and was doing homage at a shrine when an arahant Therī in front of her hastily spat in the court of the shrine. Seeing the spittle and not knowing who had committed the fault, she said in reproof, ”What prostitute has been spitting here?” It was owing to this remark that she was born as a courtesan in her last birth (ThigA.206-7).<br>The Apadāna (quoted also in ThigA) gives some more details about her. She had been a daughter of a Khattiya family in the time of Phussa Buddha and had done many good deeds in order to be beautiful in later births. As a result of the abuse of the nun (referred to above) she had been born in hell and later had, for ten thousand lives, been a courtesan. In Kassapa Buddha’s time she had practised celibacy (Ap.ii.613ff. ; ThigA.213f).<br>It is said that she charged fifty kahāpaṇas a night from her patrons and that Vesāli became very prosperous through her. It was this that prompted Bimbisāra to get a courtesan for his own city of Rājagaha (Vin.i.268).<br>Among Ambapālī’s patrons was Bimbisāra, and he was the father of her son Vimala-Kondañña (ThagA.i.146).<br>In the Theragāthā (vv.1020-21; ThagA.ii.129) there are two verses which, according to tradition, were spoken by Ananda in admonition of monks who lost their heads at the sight of Ambapālī. Whether this was before or after she joined the Order we are not told.'],

'ambasakkhara':['One of the Licchavi chieftains of Vesāli during the Buddha’s time. He was a nihilist by persuasion.<br>Once while going through the city he saw a beautiful woman. Wishing to possess her, he commandeered her husband’s services and one day ordered him to bring mud and lotuses from a pond three leagues away, his life to be the penalty if he did not return the same evening. Meanwhile Ambasakkhara ordered the guards to shut the city gates earlier than usual. The woman’s husband returned to the city before nightfall, but finding the gates shut, he asked a thief, who was impaled just outside, to bear witness to his having arrived before sunset.<br>The thief’s uncle had been a pious merchant in Vesāli, but had been beheaded for alleged implication in his nephew’s theft. He had been reborn as a peta, and because of his good deeds he possessed various powers. By reason, however, of having once hidden, in jest, the clothes of a friend who was bathing in the river, he was born naked. Every night he came to see his nephew and encouraged him to go on living, in spite of his impalement, because the peta knew that suffering in hell awaited the thief after death.<br>When the man with the lotuses asked the thief’s assistance in proving his innocence, he was advised to await the peta’s arrival that night and to get his counsel. This the man did, and when, the next day, he was summoned before Ambasakkhara, he cited the peta as witness for his defence. Ambasakkhara agreed to test the truth of the story, and in the night he saw the peta and learnt all that had happened. Greatly marvelling, he offered to help the peta in getting rid of his nudity. He was asked to seek the holy Elder Kappitaka who lived in Kapinaccanā in the Vajji country and give him robes in the peta’s name. This was done, and the peta immediately appeared before them clad in heavenly robes. From that time Ambasakkhara was converted to the Faith, and after having listened to a sermon by Kappitaka became a Sotāpanna.<br>The impaled thief was set free and was cured by the royal physician; he later attained to the state of an arahant.

'ambatittha':['A village in the Cetiya country nearBhaddavatikā.<br>When the Buddha was on tour near there he was repeatedly warned by the cowherds not to go to Ambatittha as in the Jatila’s hermitage in the village dwelt a mighty Nāga. While the Buddha was yet in Bhaddavatikā the Elder Sāgata went to the Jatila’s hermitage and took up his abode near the fireplace. The Nāga showed his resentment, but Sāgata was able to overcome him by means of his iddhi-powers. Later Sāgata visited the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā and went with him to Kosambī. The fame of the Elder’s victory over the Nāga had preceded him and the inhabitants of Kosambī were lavish in their hospitality to him. He drank wine in their houses and had to be carried to see the Buddha.<br>The latter made this the occasion for declaring the drinking of intoxicants to be a pāciṭṭiya-offence.

'ambatitthaka':['1. Ambatitthaka.-A Tamil stronghold surrounded by a river and a moat; it was captured by Dutthagāmāni after a siege of four months (Mhv.xxv.7-9).

'ambaṭṭha':['The charm learnt by Kanha, ancestor of the Kanhāyanas, from the ascetics of Dakhinajanapada.<br>The charm had the power of disarming those who tried to attack its possessor.<br>With the aid of this charm Kanha won Maddarūpī, daughter of Okkāka. D.i.96; DA.i.265.<br>ambaṭṭha<br>The clan to which Ambattha-mānava belonged. The Kanhāyana-gotta was probably one of its chief sections, or, perhaps, the family of its original ancestors. In the Buddha’s time the clan was evidently considered very aristocratic, at least by its own members, for they looked down upon even the Sākiyans as scorings from their kinsmen’s feet, though the Sākiyans themselves seem to have laughed at the pretensions of the Ambatthas (See Ambattha-mānava above). Nor were the Ambatthas brahmins by birth; some of them were farmers and traders and some even sold their daughters for gold. J.iv.363; they were called brahmins by courtesy vohāravasena (ibid., 366).<br>According to the Mānavadhammasāstra, they were not sprung from Ksatriya father and a slave (presumably Sudra) mother, as given in the Ambattha Sutta, but from a brahmin father and a Vaisya mother.<br>The Ambatthas were of an old stock and were well known. Besides the Ambattha-mānava mentioned above, another Ambattha, called Sūra, is spoken of in the Pitakas (E.g., A.i.26; iii.451).<br>ambaṭṭha<br>1. Ambattha.-(usually called Ambattha-mānava). A brahmin youth of the Ambattha clan who lived with his teacher, Pokkharasādi, at Ukkatthā. He was learned in the three Vedas and the correlated branches of knowledge, including the Lokāyata, as recorded in the Ambattha Sutta (D.3). Once, at the request of his teacher, he visited the Buddha in the Icchānadkala wood and seems to have opened his conversation by reviling the Sākiyans and calling them menials. It appears that Ambattha had once gone on some business of Pokkharasādi’s to Kapilavatthu, to the Mote Hall of the Sākyans, and had been insulted there (D.i.91).<br>Asked by the Buddha to what family he belonged, Ambattha replied that he came of the Kanhāyana-gotta; thereupon the Buddha traced the family back to its ancestor, who had been the offspring of a slave girl of Okkāka, named Disā. The child had been able to talk as soon as he was born and, because of this devilish trait, had been called Kanha (devil), hence the family name. Kanha later became a mighty seer and married Maddarūpī, daughter of Okkāka (D.i.96-7).<br>Ambattha makes no remonstrance against this genealogy and, under pressure, accepts it as true. This gives the Buddha an opportunity of preaching on the futility of feeling vanity regarding one’s caste and on the worth of morality and conduct.<br>At the end of the discourse the Buddha walked up and down outside his chamber so that Ambattha might see on his body the thirty-two signs of a great man. Ambattha goes back to Pokkharasadi and reports the whole interview. Pokkharasādi is greatly incensed, abuses Ambattha and kicks him. Later Pokkharasādi goes himself to the Buddha and invites him for a meal. At the end of the meal the Buddha instructs him in his Doctrine and is accepted as the Teacher both of Pokkharasādi himself and of his followers and dependants at Ukkatthā. Pokkharasādi himself becomes a Sotāpanna (DA.i.278).<br>We are not told that Ambattha became a follower of the Buddha. Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.274) that the Buddha knew that Ambattha would not profit by his discourse in his present life (iminā attabhāvena magga-pātubhāvo natthi), and that therefore a sermon with the idea of converting him would only have meant spending unnecessary time. Ambattha himself only visited the Buddha on account of his interest in physiognomy. According to Buddhaghosa the idea of the Buddha in preaching the Ambattha Sutta at such length was that it might be repeated to Pokkharasādi.<br>It is conjectured that the Ambattha, who is identified with Kāvinda, one of the counsellors of King Vedeha, in the Ummagga Jātaka (J.vi.478), probably refers to the Ambattha of this sutta.<br>2. Ambattha.-A king of old, at whose court Rāhulamātā in one of her former lives had been a handmaid.

No mention is made of the advice not to cling to matters muṇḍane, nor of the death of the banker almost immediately afterwards. Instead, it is stated that Sāriputta and Ananda were given a meal from the banker’s own cooking-pot and that they went away after thanking him.

For a time the experiment succeeds, but later, as a result of the king’s scheming, the girl starts an intrigue with a flower-seller as lover and is discovered (J.i.289ff).<br>The Jātaka is so called because the woman in the story was guarded from the time she lay in her mother’s womb as a foetus (andabhūta).<br>The story was related concerning a monk who was worried by his passions.'],

'andhakavinda':['A village in the Magadha country, three gāvuta from Rājagaha. Between it and Rājagaha is the river Sappinī, which rises in theGijjhakūta (Vin.i.109; Vin. Texts i.254, n.2). Once the Buddha went fromBenares to Andhakavinda with 1,250 monks, and many people followed them carrying cartloads of provisions that they might feed them in turn. There were so many awaiting their turn that a certain brahmin (referred to as Andhakavindabrāhmana) had to wait two months for his to come round. At the end of two months, finding that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency he could possibly supply. Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he approached Ananda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha’s permission, the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the monks. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke of the tenfold good qualities of milk-rice. Vin.i.220f.; it was this praise uttered by the Buddha that made Visākhā ask him, as a favour, that she should be allowed to supply milk-rice to the monks throughout her life (ibid., 293); see also UdA.112.<br>During the same visit of the Buddha, a newly converted minister of the district prepared meat dishes for the fraternity, but being disappointed that the monks, who had had a meal of solid milk-rice earlier, could not eat large quantities of his dishes, he was rather rude to them. Later he expressed remorse, and the Buddha assured him that heaven would be his inheritance (Vin.i.222f. This was the occasion for the rule that monks who have been invited to a meal in one place should not accept milk-rice somewhere else earlier in the same day.). It was on the way back from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha that the Buddha met Belattha Kaccāna (Vin.i.224f).<br>Once when the Buddha was staying at Andhakavinda the BrahmāSahampati came and lighted the place with his effulgent beauty till late at night; then he sought the Buddha and sang before him verses of exhortation meant for the monks, urging them to lead the holy life (S.i.154). Here, too, the Buddha mentioned to Ananda the necessity of admonishing and encouraging new members of the Order with regard to five things: good conduct, control of the faculties of sense, abstinence from too much talking, love of solitude and the cultivation of right views (A.iii.138-9; referred to in Sp.iv.789).<br>Once in Andhakavinda the Buddha suffered from disease of the wind. Ananda was asked to obtain gruel for the complaint. The wife of the village physician supplied the gruel with great devotion, and as a result was born inTāvatimsa, where her abode was known as the Kañjikādāyika vimāna (VvA.185-6). Another lay devotee built a Gandhakuti for the Buddha at Andhakavinda, and personally looked after the Buddha while he was there. This upāsaka was also, as a result, born in Tāvatimsa in a golden vimāna (VvA.302-3).<br>Cūlasetthi’s daughter, Anulā, lived in Andhakavinda after her marriage and it was there that she gave alms on behalf of her dead father (PvA.105-9).'],

'andhavana':['A grove to the south of Sāvatthi, one gāvuta away from the city. It was well guarded and monks and nuns used to resort there in search of solitude. During the time of Kassapa Buddha, thieves waylaid an anāgāmī upāsaka in this forest; his name was Sorata (Yasodhara, according to the Samyutta Cy), and he had been touring Jambudīpa collecting money for the Buddha’s cetiya. They gouged out his eyes and killed him. Thereupon the robbers all lost their sight and wandered about the forest blind; hence the name of the forest (”Blind,” usually, but wrongly, translated ”Dark”). It had retained its name during two Buddha-periods. The story is given in MA.i.336ff. and SA.i.148.<br>There was a Meditation Hall (padhāna-ghara) built there for the use of contemplative monks and nuns (MA.i.338). Stories are told of those, particularly the nuns, who were tempted by Māra in the Andhavana. E.g., āḷavikā, Soma,Kisāgotamī, Vijayā, Uppalavannā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā; J.i.128ff. and ThigA.64, 66, 163.<br>Once when Anuruddha was staying there he became seriously sick (S.v.302). It was here that the Buddha preached to Rāhula the discourse (Cūla-Rāhulovāda) which made him an arahant (S.iv.105-7; AA.i.145).<br>Among others who lived here from time to time are mentioned the Elders Khema, Soma (A.iii.358), and Sāriputta (A.v.9), the last-mentioned experiencing a special kind of samādhi (where he realised that bhavanirodha was nibbāna).<br>The Theragātha Commentary (i.39) records a discussion here between Sāriputta and Punna regarding purification (visuddhikamma). The Vammikā Sutta (M.i.143ff ) was the result of questions put by an anāgami Brahma, his erstwhile colleague, to Kumāra-kassapa, while he was in Andhavana.<br>Once bandits laid an ambush for Pasenadi as he went through the forest to pay his respects to the Buddha, attended by a small escort, as was sometimes his wont. He was warned in time and had the wood surrounded, capturing and impaling or crucifying the bandits on either side of the road through the wood. We are told that though the Buddha knew of this, he did not chide the king because he had certain reasons for not doing so. (See SA.i.131-2. Mrs. Rhys Davids doubts the authenticity of this story; KS.i.127n.)<br>The Therī Uppalavannā was raped in a hut in the forest by a young brahmin named Ananda, and it is said that from that time nuns did not live in Andhavana (DhA.ii.49, 52).<br>The Pārājikā (Vin.iii.28ff ) contains stories of monks who committed offences in the forest with shepherdesses and others, and also of some monks who ate the flesh of a cow which had been left behind, partly eaten, by cattle thieves (Vin.iii.64). It was here that Uppalavannā obtained the piece of cow’s flesh which she asked Udāyi to offer to the Buddha, giving Udāyi her inner robe as ”wages” for the job (the story is told in Vin.iii.208-9).<br>The Pārichattakavimāna (VvA.172ff ) was the abode which fell to the lot of a woman who having plucked an asoka-flower, while getting firewood in Andhavana, offered it to the Buddha.<br>The rule forbidding monks to enter a village clad only in their waist cloth and nether garment was made with reference to a monk whose robe had been stolen by thieves in Andhavana (Vin.i.298).'],

'aṅga':['1. Anga. (See also Angā).-One of the stock list of the sixteen Powers or Great Countries (Mahājanapadā), mentioned in the Pitakas. E.g., A.i.213; iv.252, 256, 260.<br>The countries mentioned are Anga, Magadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajji, Mallā, Cetī, Vamsā, Kuru, Pañcāla, Macchā, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avantī, Gandhāra, and Kamboja. Other similar lists occur elsewhere, e.g. D.ii.200 (where ten countries are mentioned); see also Mtu.i.34 and i.198; and Lal.24(22).<br>It was to the east of Magadha, from which it was separated by the River Campā, and had as its capital city Campā, near the modern Bhagalpur (Cunningham, pp. 546-7). Other cities mentioned are Bhaddiya (DA.i.279; DhA.i.384) and Assapura (M.i.271).<br>The country is generally referred to by the name of its people, the Angā, though occasionally (E.g., DhA.i.384) the name Angarattha is used. In the Buddha’s time it was subject to Magadha, (ThagA.i.548) whose king Bimbisāra was, we are told, held in esteem also by the people of Anga (MA.i.394), and the people of the two countries evidently used to pay frequent visits to each other (J.ii.211). We never hear of its having regained its former independence, and traditions of war between the two countries are mentioned (E.g., J.iv.454; J.v.316; J.vi.271).<br>In the Buddha’s time the Angarājā was just a wealthy nobleman, and he is mentioned merely as having granted a pension to a Brahmin (M.ii.163). The people of Anga and Magadha are generally mentioned together, so we may gather that by the Buddha’s time they had become one people. They provide Uruvela-Kassapa with offerings for his great sacrifice (Vin.i.27). It was their custom to offer an annual sacrifice to Mahā-Brahmā in the hope of gaining reward a hundred thousand fold. On one occasion Sakka appears in person and goes with them to the Buddha so that they may not waste their energies in futile sacrifices (SA.i.269-70).<br>Several discourses were preached in the Anga country, among them being the Sonadanda Sutta and the two Assapura Suttas (Mahā- and Cūla-). TheMahāgovinda Sutta seems to indicate that once, in the past, Dhatarattha was king of Anga. But this, perhaps, refers to another country (Dial.ii.270 n.; see also The Rāmāyana i.8, 9, 17, 25).<br>Sona Kolivisa, before he entered the Order, was a squire (paddhagu) of Anga. Thag.v.632.<br>2.

Anga.-A king of Benares on whose feet hair grew. He inquired of the brahmins the way to heaven, and was told to retire to the forest and tend the sacred fire. He went to Himavā with many cows and women and did as he was counselled. The milk and ghee left over from his sacrifices were thrown away, and from them arose many minor rivers, the Ganges itself, and even the sea. Later he became Indra’s companion. J.vi.203<br>4. Anga.-King of the Anga country, between whom and King Magadha there was constant war, with varying fortunes. In the end, Magadha, with the help of the Nāga king Campeyya, seized Anga and slew him. J.iv.453.<br>5. Anga.-One of the Pacceka Buddhas mentioned in the list in the Apadana Commentary. ApA.i.107.<br>6.

In the Commentaries three etymologies are given: Buddhaghosa says that ”it means emitting rays of various hues from the body,” and that the word is therefore applicable to all Buddhas alike (DA.iii.963). Dhammapāla adds that it signifies being possessed of attainments such as virtue, and also that according to some, Angirasa was a personal name given by the Buddha’s father in addition to Siddhatha (ThagA.i.503. It is worth noting that in AA.i.381 Siddhattha is referred to as Angīrasa Kumāra.)<br>It is, however, well-known that, according to Vedic tradition, the Gautamas belong to the Angirasa tribe (see Vedic Index: Gotama); the word, as applied to the Buddha, therefore, is probably a patronymic, in which case we have another example of a Ksatriya tribe laying claim to a brahmin gotra. See Thomas: Life and Legend of the Buddha, p.22-3.<br>2. Angirasa.-Another name (Angirasa gahapati) for Asayha. Pv.p.25, vv.23 and 27 ff.; also PvA.124.<br>3.

The ascetic disturbed the animals when Ajjuna was waiting to hunt, and the king, in anger, shot at him with a poisoned arrow (J.v.135, 144 and 145; DA.i.266).

The finger-bones thus obtained he made into a garland to hang round his neck, hence the name Angulimāla.<br>As a result of his deeds whole villages were deserted, and the king ordered a detachment of men to seize the bandit, whose name nobody knew. But Angulimāla’s mother, guessing the truth, started off to warn him. By now he lacked but one finger to complete his thousand, and seeing his mother coming he determined to kill her. But the Buddha, seeing his upanissaya, went himself to the wood, travelling thirty yojanas, (DA.i.240; J.iv.180) and intercepted Angulimāla on his way to slay his mother. Angulimāla was converted by the Buddha’s power and received the ”ehi bhikkhu pabbajjā” (Thag.868-70) while the populace were yelling at the king’s palace for the robber’s life. Later, the Buddha presented him before King Pasenadi when the latter came to Jetavana, and Pasenadi, filled with wonder, offered to provide the monk with all requisites. Angulimāla, however, had taken on the dhutaṅgas and refused the king’s offer.<br>When he entered Sāvatthi for alms, he was attacked by the mob, but on the admonition of the Buddha, endured their wrath as penance for his former misdeeds.<br>According to the Dhammapadaṭṭhakatha (iii.169) he appears to have died soon after he joined the Order.<br>There is a story of how he eased a woman’s labour pains by an act of truth. The words he used in this saccakiriyā (yato aham sabbaññutabuddhassa ariyassa ariyāya jātiyā jāto) have come to be regarded as a paritta to ward off all dangers and constitute the Angulimāla Paritta. The water that washed the stone on which he sat in the woman’s house came to be regarded as a panacea (M.ii.103-4; MA.747f).<br>In the Angulimāla Sutta he is addressed by Pasenādi as Gagga Mantānīputta, his father being a Gagga. The story is evidently a popular one and occurs also in the Avadāna Sataka (No.27).<br>At the Kosala king’s Asadisadāna, an untamed elephant, none other being available, was used to bear the parasol over Angulimāla. The elephant remained perfectly still - such was Angulimāla’s power (DhA.iii.185; also DA.ii.654).<br>The conversion of Angulimāla is often referred to as a most compassionate and wonderful act of the Buddha’s, e.g. in theSutasoma Jātaka, (J.v.456f.; see also J.iv.180; SnA.ii.440; DhA.i.124) which was preached concerning him. The story of Angulimāla is quoted as that of a man in whose case a beneficent kamma arose and destroyed former evil kamma (AA.i.369).<br>It was on his account that the rule not to ordain a captured robber was enacted (Vin.i.74).<br>For his identification with Kalmāsapāda see J.P.T.S., 1909, pp. 240ff.'],
'anguttara nikāya':['The fourth division of the Sutta Pitaka, consisting of eleven nipātas (sections) and 9,557 suttas (A.v.361; DA.i.23; Gv.56). The suttas are arranged in numbered lists, probably as aids to memory. Thus we find set out in order first the units, then the pairs, the trios etc., up to groups of eleven. This method of arrangement has evidently influenced the subject matter as well, for we seldom see any reasoned arguments. The lists are often curtly given and curtly explained (See also Hardy’s remarks, A.v. introd. p.vii).<br>At the first Council Anuruddha was asked to be the custodian of this Nikāya of 120 bhānavāras and to read it to his pupils (DA.i.15; Mbv.94).<br>When the Buddha’s religion fades away, the first portion of the Sutta Pitaka to disappear will be the Anguttara Nikāya from the eleventh section to the first, and in that order (MA.881).<br>It was also sometimes called Ekuttara. Mil. 392. It is worthy of note that the Ekottarāgama Sutra of the Chinese is unlike the Anguttara Nikaya (A.i. introd. ix., n.4).<br>The Anguttara Nikaya quotes the Parāyana, which is evidence of its late compilation. (i.133 and 134; ii.45. For other quotations in and from the Anguttara Nikaya see A.v., introd. p.ix., nn. 3 and 4.)<br>The Commentary to the Anguttara Nikāya is called Manorathapūranī.'],

FromBhaddiya (in Anga), (DhA.i.384) the Buddha went to Anguttārapa and thence to āpaṇa (Vin.i.243-5; DhA.iii.363).<br>The country was probably rich because we find as many as 1,250 monks accompanying the Buddha on his tour (Sn.102f).<br>Other suttas preached here are the Potaliya (M.i.359), and the Latukikopama (M.i.447).<br>Apana seems to have been the chief township, because it is always mentioned in connection with Anguttarāpa.'],

The marriage was arranged, but the girl, being very delicate, died on the way to the bridegroom’s house. On learning the news of her death he was sorely grieved and gave himself up to despair.

'añjana':['A garden at Sāketa. In it was a Deer-park where the Buddha used to stay. On one such occasionKakudha came to see him (S.i.54), and also the Paribbājaka Kuñdaliya (S.v.73) who lived near by. Here were preached the Sāketa Sutta, (S.v.219) theSāketa Jātaka (J.i.308; DhA.iii.317ff.; SnA.531) and the Jarā Sutta.<br>When Ananda was staying there a nun of the Jatila persuasion visited him and questioned him on the use of samadhi (A.iv.427-8).<br>The Thera Jambugāmiyaputta (ThagA.i.86; SnA.531) dwelt there while yet a novice. Once the Buddha was staying at Añjanavana with a large company of monks and some of the monks slept on the sandbanks of the river Sarabhū near by. During the night floods rose and the Thera Gavampati controlled the water by his mystic powers (Ibid., i.104; Thag.v.38).<br>The elder Bhūta (ThagA.i.494) stayed in Añjana-vana while visiting his relatives in Sāketa, and the Thera Añjanavaniya spent the rainy season there on a couch (ThagA.i.127). There Sujātā met the Buddha, and having listened to his discourse became an arahant (Thig.vv.145-50).<br>In ancient times the king of Kosala used to hunt in this garden, thus it was that the deer Nandiya met him (J.iii.270f).<br>The garden was so-called because it was thickly covered with añjanna-creepers that bore collyrium-coloured flowers.

The Peta Vatthu (Pv.23ff.; PvA.111ff) contains an account of Ankura’s later career. Once he took a caravan of a thousand carts from Dvāravatī to Kamboja, led by himself and a brahmin colleague. On the way their water supply fails, but they are befriended by a Yakkha of great power, who, in his previous life, had been one of Ankura’s trusted and loyal servants. Annoyed by the suggestion of the brahmin that instead of proceeding to Kamboja they should entice the Yakkha back with them to Dvāravatī, the Yakkha appears before them in person, and in answer to Ankura’s questions, tells him that he had been a tailor in Bheruva, where lived the generous Asayha. When suppliants came in search of Asayha’s house, the tailor showed them the way. Impressed by the story, Ankura returns forthwith to Dvāravatī, and spends the rest of his life, 60,000 years (10,000 says DhA.(loc infra);Sp.i.245), in acts of unparalleled munificence. (There were as many as 3,000 cooks to supply food in his alms-halls and 60,000 youths to cut firewood.) He is reborn in Tāvatimsa.<br>In the assembly of the devas who gather to listen to the Buddha’s preaching of the Abhidhamma, Ankura occupies a place in the back row, (12 leagues away says DhA.iii.219; 10 leagues away says Pv.28, v.65) while Indaka, who had given but one spoonful of rice to Anuruddha Thera, sits quite close to the Buddha. The Buddha notices this and remarks that Indaka had been lucky in finding a worthy donee; the recipients of Ankura’s gifts had not been distinguished for their holiness. Gifts should, therefore, be given discriminately. At the end of this discourse Ankura becomes a sotāpanna. DhA.iii.222; ibid., iv.82. See also Lüders, ZDMG. 58, 700.'],

The Buddha visits them and talks about the four factors of Dhamma (dhammapadāni) which are held in esteem by everyone: not-coveting, not-malice, right-mindfulness, right-concentration (A.ii.29-31).<br>On another occasion they discuss the ”brahmin truth.” The Buddha visits them and tells them what he considers to be the brahmin truths (brāhmanasaccāni): that no creatures are to be harmed; all sense-delights are impermanent, painful and changing; all becomings are impermanent, etc.; a brahmin is one who has no part in or attachment to anything any more (A.ii.176-7).<br>2.

She was so called because her complexion was the colour of anoja-flowers.<br>When Kappina made his reṇunciation, she and her companions followed him in chariots, crossing rivers by an act of truth (saccakiriyā), saying ”the Buddha could not have arisen only for the benefit of men, but for that of women as well.”<br>When she saw the Buddha and heard him preach, she and her companions became Stream-enterers. She was ordained by Uppalavannā (AA.i. pp.176ff. ; SA.ii., pp.178ff).

He renounced household life at the age of 10,000 years, leaving home in a palanquin, and practised austerities for ten months.

'anomā':['1. Anomā.-A river thirty leagues to the east of Kapilavatthu, where Gotama went after leaving home. According to the Lalita Vistara, the river was only six yojanas from the city, and Cunningham accepts this (p. 485 ff). It was eight usabhas in breadth, but<br>Kanthaka cleared it in one leap. It was here that Gotama cut off his hair and beard and put on the orange garments of the ascetics, brought to him by the Brahmā Ghatikāra.<br>On its banks was the mango grove of Anupiya (J.i.64f.; SnA.382). Three kingdoms lay between it and Kapilavatthu. (BuA.5. The countries of the Sākiyans, Koliyans and Mallas; see Expositor i.43n., where Kapilavatthu, Devadaha and Koliya are mentioned as the three kingdoms).<br>From the river to Rājagaha was a distance of thirty leagues, which Gotama took seven days to walk (J.i.65; SnA.382). It took him a whole night to ride from Kapilavatthu to Anomā (VvA.314).<br>The name seems to have meant ”Glorious,” or ”not Slight”. See J.i.64, where Gotama asks Channa the name of the river and Channa replies ”It is Anoma (glorious).” ”Good,” says Gotama, ”my reṇunciation shall also be anomā.” The Burmese name is Anauma (Bigandet. p.41).<br>Cunningham (*) identifies the river with the modern Aumi. He states his belief that the word means ”inferior,” to distinguish it from other and larger rivers in the neighbourhood, and that the original name in Pali was Omā. According to him the confusion in names arose from a misunderstanding of Channa’s reply. It is difficult to accept this suggestion because evidently, according to the tradition quoted in the Jātaka commentary and elsewhere, the name of the river was taken as a good augury for the accomplishment of Gotama’s desires.<br>(*) p.486ff.; in the Sutta Nipāta (vv. 153, 177) and again in the Samyutta (i. 33) the Buddha is spoken of as Anomanāma. Buddhaghosa (SA.i.67) explains this as meaning having no ”defect,” endowed with perfection (sabbaguṇasamannāgatattā avekalla-nāmam; paripūranāmam).<br>Thomas (Loc cit., p. 61 and n.1), on the other hand, suggests that Anomā did not necessarily really exist. There was possibly an actual locality to the east of Kapilavatthu traditionally associated with Gotama’s flight. It was probably near Anupiya of the Malla country, and the names given to it, such as Anomā, Anomiya, Anuvaniya, Anumaniya, were corruptions of Anupiya in the popular dialects of the neighbourhood.<br>The Mahāvastu does not mention a river; it only mentions a town, Anomiya, twelve leagues from Kapilavatthu.

But when Apacara came to the throne, Kapila obtained the post for his own son and became an ascetic. When the king realised what had happened he offered to get the post back for Kosakaḷamba by means of a lie. The latter protested, because lies had hitherto been unknown in the world; but the king persisted in his desire even in spite of Kapila’s warning, and seven times in succession uttered a lie to the effect that the post of chaplain belonged by right of seniority to Kosakambala and not to Kapila’s son. At the first lie he lost his iddhi-powers and fell to earth, and with each succeeding lie he fell deeper and deeper into the earth until the flames of Avīci seized him.

In the Samantapāsādikā (iv.742) the story of the conversion of Apalāla (Apalāladamana) is given among the stories not included in the Three Councils (sangīti), but that it was known quite early in Ceylon is evidenced by the fact that, among the scenes from the Buddha’s life represented in the relic-chamber of the Mahā-Thūpa, the conversion of Apalāla is mentioned (Mhv.xxx.84). The Divyāvadāna (pp.348, 385) makes reference to the story, and states that the nāga was converted shortly before the Buddha’s death. Hiouen Thsang gives the story in detail (Beal: Records of the Western World i.122; also Legge: Fa Hien’s Travels, p.29n.). During Kassapa Buddha’s time, Apalāla had been a powerful man called Gangi. By means of his charms he subdued the dragons that attacked the country, and the people, in gratitude, agreed to give him tribute. Later some of them forgot their promise and he, in wrath, became a dragon after his death.<br>The Buddha Gotama visited him and preached to him. He was converted, but, for his sustenance, he was allowed to have one gathering of the crops every twelve years. It is for this reason that the White River (Subhavastu) overflows every twelfth year. The story is found in the Sūtrālaṅkāra and other Mahāyāna books. See Nariman: Sanskrit Buddhism, pp.194, 274.<br>According to the Vinaya of the Mūlla-Sarvāstivādins, the Buddha converted Apalāla during a visit to Kashmir in the company of the Yaksa Vajrapānī (JA.1914, vol. iv.510).'],

'aparagoyāna':['One of the four great continents into which the earth is divided. It is to the west of Sineru and is seven thousand yojanas in extent. It is surrounded by five hundred islands (SnA.ii.443). According to the Anguttara Nikāya (i.227; v.59), each cakkavāḷa (world-system) has an Aparagoyāna. It is inhabited by men (KhA.123), but they have no houses and sleep on the ground (ThagA.ii.187-8). In the centre of the continent is a Kadamba tree, whose trunk is fifteen yojanas in girth and whose trunk and arms are fifty yojanas in length.<br>This tree stands for a whole kappa (DhsA.298; AA.i.264; Vm.206).

A cakkavatti-king first conquers Pubbavideha in the east and Jambudīpa in the south, and then sets out to win Aparagoyāna in the west and Uttarakuru in the north (Mbv.73-4; BuA.113). Thus King Mandhātā, having conquered Jambudīpa, journeys on with his retinue to Aparagoyāna and conquers it straight away (Dvy.215).<br>Punnaka, in his play with Dhanañjaya, staked a jewel, by gazing into which the continent of Aparagoyāna could be seen.

'aravāla':['A Nāga king, who lived in the Aravāladaha in Kasmīra-Gandhāra.<br>He had been in the habit of destroying the crops of the people by causing hail-storms. When Majjhantika Thera was sent by Moggaliputtatissa’s Council to convert Kasmīra-Gandhāra, the Thera went to Aravāladaha and standing in the air above it showed himself to the Nāgas. Hearing of this the nāga king came out and tried to frighten the Elder with various terrors. When all his attempts had failed he acknowledged defeat and the Thera preached to him. He and his 84,000 followers were established in the Refuge and the Five Precepts (v.l. āravāla). Sp.i.65; Mhv.xii.9-20.'],

'arimaddana':['The name given in the Pāli chronicles to the city of Pagan in Burma (Rāmañña) (Bode: op. cit., 14). During the time of Parakkamabāhu I. of Ceylon, the King of Arimaddana quarrelled with him, ill-treated his envoys, and seized by force a princess sent from Ceylon to Kamboja. Parakkama sent a punitive expedition under the Damilādhikāri ādicca, who reduced the country to subjection (Cv.lxxvi.10-75).<br>Later Vijayabāhu II. of Ceylon entered into friendly negotiations with the ruler of Arimaddana, and wrote him a letter in the Māgadha language composed by himself. As a result, a friendly treaty was made between them which also resulted in closer contact between the monks of the two countries (Cv.lxxx.6-8).<br>According to some authorities, quoted by Minayeff (Recherches sur Bouddhisme, p.70), the city was full of learned women. The Gandhavamsa (p.67) mentions a list of twenty-three teachers who wrote their works in Arimaddana. From this context it appears that Arimaddana was known also as Pukkāma (Pukkāmasankhāte Arimaddananagare). This is supported by evidence from elsewhere (Forchhammer: Jardine Prize Essay, pp.29, 32. Ind. Ant.1893, p.17). It was a minister in Arimaddana who wrote the Nyāsappadīpatīkā (Svd.v.1240). Arimaddana was also the city of birth of the Thera Chapata (Svd.v.1247).'],

During the time of Sikhī Buddha he held a great almsgiving for the Buddha and his monks; he presented to the Order a fully caparisoned elephant which he redeemed by giving suitable gifts to the height of an elephant (J.i.41; Bu.xxi.9). He had as friend the chaplain’s son, Sonaka. They both studied in Takkasilā and at the conclusion of their studies they travelled about in search of experience. In the course of their travels Arindama was elected to succeed the King of Benares who had died childless, and Sonaka became a Pacceka Buddha. Forty years later Arindama wished to see Sonaka, but no one could tell him his whereabouts in spite of the offer of a large reward. Ten years later Sonaka saw the king through the good offices of a lad of seven, who belonged to the harem and had learnt a song composed by the king expressing his desire to meet Sonaka. At the meeting, however, the king failed to recognise him. Sonaka, not revealing his identity, spoke to the king about the joys of reṇunciation, and disappeared through the air. The king, moved by his words, decided to give up the throne and to follow the ascetic life. He appointed his eldest sonDīghāvu king in his stead, handed over to him all his possessions, and developing supernatural faculties was born in the Brahma world (J.v.247-61).<br>Arindama is mentioned together with Mahājanaka as an example of a king who renounced a mighty kingdom to lead a hermit’s life (J.iii.489). The story also appears in the Mahāvastu (iii.449ff), but the details given differ from those of the Jātaka version. There Arindama is spoken of as the King of Mithilā.<br>In both accounts Dīghāvu’s mother, the king’s chief queen, is spoken of as having died before the king’s reṇunciation.<br>According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.203), Arindama’s capital was Paribhuttanagara.

A great dispute had arisen at this time regarding nirodha and all the inhabitants of many thousand world systems were divided into two camps. In order to settle their doubts, the disputants, with Arindama at their head, sought the Buddha. The Buddha sat on Mount Yugandhara while Arindama, with his ninety thousand crores of followers, sat on a golden rock, which by the power of his merit had sprung from the earth near Sankassa. The Buddha preached to them, and at the end of the sermon they all became arahants. BuA.128-9.<br>3. Arindama.-King of Uttara. When Revata Buddha visited his city the king went to see him, accompanied by three crores of people.

We find the Buddha rebuking the nunThullanandā for associating with Arittha after the ukkhepanīyakamma (Vin.iv.218).<br>It was Arittha’s heresy that led to the preaching of theAlagaddūpama Sutta (M.i.130ff).<br>In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.314-15), Arittha is mentioned as having said to the Buddha that he practised concentration in breathing and as having described how he did it.

'ariṭṭhapabbata':['A mountain in Ceylon half-way between Anurādhapura and Pulatthipuva. It is identified with modern Ritigala, and is near the modern Habarane in the North-Central Province (Mhv.trans.72, n.3). Pandukābhaya lived there for seven years, awaiting an opportunity to make war on his uncles, and it was near there that he ultimately defeated them (Mhv.x.63-72).

The Buddha, seeing his upanissaya for sotāpatti, passed with the congregation of monks close by the spot where he was fishing and stopped not far from him. Then the Buddha proceeded to ask the monks their names, and noticing that the fisherman himself expected to be questioned, he asked him his. On learning that it was Ariya, the Buddha suggested to him that he was unworthy of the name, because a real Ariya never injured any living thing.

'ariyagālatissa':['Son of Mahādhanadeva, of Mahāgāma. When he was a child he was called Keliyatissa, because he liked to play. Later he joined the Order. Dissatisfied after five years, he gave up his robes and swam down a river. Two women bathing saw him and both claimed him. When they saw he was naked one went to fetch clothes; the other gave him half her garment and took him to her parents and married him. The wife was Sumanā. Because he was found in the river he was called Gaṅga-tissa; but because he was lazy they called him Nikkammatissa. Sumanā’s people complained of him and sent them away. Tissa sought work under a headman, Candasuriya, a friend of Mahādhanadeva, and reaped and threshed a field of 500 karīsas in one day. Candasuriya, marvelling at his strength, gave him all the grain.<br>Thereafter, Tissa and his wife gave alms daily to eight monks, but as his meals were not tasty, the monks called him Udakalonatissa. Discovering this, he gave them milk rice and was called Khīrabhatta-tissa. Later he gave rice mixed with ghee and his name became Kalyānabhatta-tissa. In due course he fed 500 monks daily. One day, while looking for yams in Kumbulapabbata, he discovered 60 treasure troves and took them home. Later he fed many thousands of monks in Cetiyamba-vihāra, Anurādhapura and Nāgadīpa and lived in Ariyagālatittha as a ferryman, taking people across, free of charge. Sakka, wishing to test him, came as an old brahmin and, having tried his patience, filled his house with valuables and gave him a field of rice.<br>Once a discussion arose in Piyangudīpa, as to where the most devout people were to be found. Satisambodhi Thera said they were in Ceylon, while Yonakarājaputta Mahābuddharakkhita said they were in Yonakarattha. To test this, Satisambodhi arrived in Tissa’s house. His wife, having fed 12,000 monks, was resting, but having seen the Elder she prepared for him a bowl of catuma-dhura. He asked her to throw the bowl up into the air. It travelled to Piyangudīpa, and Sumanā saw the monks as they ate the contents.<br>As Tissa lay dying, devas brought him chariots from the six deva worlds; he chose to be born in Tusita. His wife, knowing his wishes, retired into her room and died before him. They were both born in Tusita. In a past birth Tissa had been in Chagāma and honoured the Bodhi-tree there. Ras.ii.34f.'],

'ariyapariyesanā sutta':['Preached in Sāvatthi in the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka. Some monks expressed to Ananda their desire to hear a discourse from the Buddha, as it was so long since they had heard one. He advised them to go to the hermitage of Rammaka where their wishes might be fulfilled. The noontide of that same day Amanda spent with the Buddha at the Pubbārāma in the Migāramātupāsāda and in the evening, after the Buddha had bathed in the Pubbakoṭṭhaka, Ananda suggested to him that he might go to Rammaka’s hermitage. The Buddha assenting, they went together. The Buddha, finding the monks engaged in discussing the Doctrine, waited till their discussion was over. Having inquired the topic thereof, he praised them and proceeded to tell them of the two quests in the world-the noble and the ignoble.<br>He described how he, too, before his Enlightenment, had followed the quest, apprenticing himself to various teachers, such asĀlāra-Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, and how, on discovering that they could not give him what he sought, he went to Uruvelā and there found the consummate peace of Nibbāna. This biographical account is also found in the Mahā-Saccaka, Bodhirājakumāra and Sangārava-Suttas. It is in part repeated in the Vinaya and the Digha Nikāya.<br>The Sutta then proceeds to give an account of the Buddha’s first reluctance to preach, of Sahampati’s intervention, of the meeting with the Ājivaka Upaka and the first sermon preached to the Pañcavaggiyas. Finally the sutta expounds the pleasures of the senses, the dangers there from and the freedom and confidence which ensue when one has overcome desire (M.i.160-75).<br>In the Commentary (MA.i.369ff) the sutta is called Pāsarāsi, evidently because of the simile found at the end of the discourse where the pleasures of the senses are compared to baited traps.<br>The Atthasālinī quotes it (p.35).'],
'ariyasāvaka sutta':['1. Ariyasāvaka Sutta.-Preached at Sāvatthi.

'ariyavaṃsa':['1. Ariyavamsa.-A compilation, probably of the life-histories of men eminent in the Buddhist Order, made in Ceylon and read aloud publicly for the edification of the people. The reading of the Ariyavamsa seems once to have been a regular feature of gatherings in the Buddhist vihāras on feast days. King Vohāraka-T1ssa made endowments for the giving of alms throughout Ceylon on the occasions when the Ariyavamsa was read (Mhv.xxxvi.38; Mhv.trans.258, n.6). A sutta called Ariyavamsa Sutta is mentioned in the Commentaries (DA.i.50; MA.i.14) as an example of a discourse preached by the Buddha on his own initiative (attajjhāsaya). This perhaps refers to the sermon on the four Ariyavaṃsā in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.ii.27). See also Mahā-Ariyavamsa.<br>2. Ariyavamsa.-A celebrated teacher and author of the fifteenth century. He came from Pagan and was a member of the Chapata sect. He was a pupil of the famous Ye-din (”water-carrier”) of Sagaing (for an account of him see Bode, op. cit., 41f), and with great zeal and enthusiasm learnt the Abhidhammattha-vibhāvanī from his teacher. Later, Ariyavamsa wrote a commentary on this work and called it the Manisāramañjūsā. A charming anecdote is related of how he read the work to his colleagues and readily accepted their corrections with gratitude.<br>Among his other works are the Manidīpa, a Tīkā on the Atthasālinī, a grammatical treatise, the Gandhābharaṇa, and a study of the Jātakas called the Jātakavisodhana.<br>Ariyavamsa spent only a part of his life at Sagaing and afterwards taught at Ava, where the king was sometimes among his listeners. He was among the first of Burmese litterateurs to write a metaphysical work in the vernacular - an Anutīkā on the Abhidhamma (Sās. p.41ff).

Another of his wives became, in her last life, the Therī Somā (ThigA.66), who is perhaps to be identified with Uppaladāyikā of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.601f).

(In the main story the king’s name is given as Assaka, but the scholiast says his real name was Aruna). The Kālinga king of that time, longing for a fight, but finding no one willing to accept his challenge, at last devised a plan. He sent his four beautiful daughters, in a covered carriage and with an armed escort to the various cities in the neighbourhood, proclaiming that any king, who took them as wives, would have to fight their father. No one was found willing to take the risk till they came to Potali in the Assaka country. Even the Assaka king at first merely sent them a present by way of courtesy, but his minister, Nandisena, fertile in expedients, urged the king to marry them, saying that he himself would undertake to face the consequences. The Kālinga king at once set out with his army. On his way to Potali, he came across the Bodhisatta, who was leading the ascetic life and, without revealing his identity, consulted him regarding his chances of success in the fight. The Bodhisatta promised that he would see Sakka about it the next day and, having done so, informed the king that the Kālinga forces would win. Nandisena heard of this prophecy but, nothing daunted, he gathered together the Assaka forces and all their allies; then, by a well-planned manoeuvre, he managed to have the tutelary deity of Kālinga (who was fighting for the Kālinga king) killed by Assaka. Thereupon the Kālinga king was routed and fled. The Bodhisatta, finding that his prophecy had turned out false, sought Sakka in his distress; Sakka consoled him thus: ”Hast thou never heard that even the gods favour the bold hero of intrepid resolve, who never yields?”<br>Later, at the suggestion of Nandisena, the Assaka king demanded of Kālinga’s ruler dowry for his four daughters, and the Kālinga king acceded to his request.

The Teacher had a mother aged 120 years, on whom he himself waited. When the youth came back to learn the Asātamanta, he was asked to look after the old woman. She, falling in love with him, hatched a plot to kill her son.<br>The Bodhisatta, having been told of this plot, made a wooden figure and placed it in his bed.

'asibandhakaputta':['A gāmāni (headman). He came to the Buddha in the Pārileyyaka Mango Grove inNālandā and asked him various questions, recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (iv.312ff). One of these related to the custom among the Pacchābhumaka (Westlander) brahmins (where, perhaps, he himself belonged) of lifting a man up when dead and carrying him out, calling him by name to speed him heavenward. Surely the Buddha who is an arahant, etc., could make the whole world go to heaven thus if he chose. To this the Buddha answers no, and explains, by various similes, that only a man’s kamma can determine where he will be reborn. On another occasion, the Buddha tells him, in answer to a question, that the Buddha teaches the Dhamma in full only to certain disciples and not to others; just as a farmer sowing seed selects, first the best field, then the moderate, and lastly, the field with the worst soil.<br>Asibandhakaputta tells the Buddha that, according toNigantha Nātaputta (he is described as a Nigantha-Sāvaka, S.iv.317), as a man habitually lives so goes he forth to his destiny. The Buddha points out the absurdity of this view and tells him that all Tathāgatas lay down definite rules for the guidance of their followers, so that they may attain development.<br>It is recorded (S.iv.322ff) that once, when Nālandā was stricken with famine, Asibandhaka visited Nigantha Nātaputta, who asks him to go and defeat the Buddha in debate. Asibandhaka is at first reluctant, but his teacher propounds to him a dilemma to put to the Buddha, and he agrees to go.<br>Is it true that the Buddha extols compassion to clansmen? Why, then, does the Buddha ask for alms in a place stricken with famine? The Buddha’s answer is that there are eight ways of injuring clansmen, and that begging for alms is not one of them. And Asibandhakaputta, pleased with the answer, declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha.<br>Asibandhakaputta’s conversation with the Buddha, in which the Buddha tells him that only a man’s kamma can determine the state of his rebirth, is quoted in the Nettippaka-rana (pp.45-47).'],
'asilakkhaṇa jātaka':['In Benares was a brahmin who could tell, by smelling them, whether swords were lucky or not. One day, while testing a sword, he sneezed and cut off the tip of his nose.

They wished to marry, but the king, having other plans, kept them apart. The prince bribed an old woman to get his beloved for him. The old woman reported to the king that his daughter was under the influence of witchcraft and that the only way of curing her was to take her to the cemetery under armed escort, where she must be laid on a bed under which was a corpse, and there she must be bathed for the purpose of exorcism.<br>The prince was to impersonate the corpse, being provided with pepper in order that he might sneeze at the right moment; the guard were warned that if the exorcism succeeded, the dead body would sneeze, rise up and kill the first thing it could lay hold of. The plot succeeded, the guard taking to their heels when the prince sneezed. The two lovers were married and were forgiven by the king. Later, they became king and queen.<br>One day the sword-testing brahmin was standing in the sun when the false tip of his nose melted and fell off. He stood hanging his head for very shame. ”Never mind,” laughed the king, ”sneezing is bad for some, but good for others. A sneeze lost you your nose, but a sneeze won for me both my throne and my queen.”<br>The story was related in reference to a brahmin of the kingdom of Kosala who tested swords by smelling them. He accepted bribes and passed the swords only of those who had won his favour. One day an exasperated dealer put pepper on his sword so that when the brahmin smelt it he sneezed, slitting his nose. The monks were once talking about him when the Buddha entered and told them the story of the past. The two brahmins were one and the same man in different births. J.i.455-8.'],

'asita':['1. Asita.-Often called the Buddhist Simeon, though the comparison is not quite correct. He was a sage and the chaplain of Sīhahanu, father of Suddhodana. He was the teacher of the Suddhodana, and later his chaplain. He came morning and evening to see the king, Suddhodana, who showed him as great respect as he had while yet his pupil; this, we are told, is a characteristic of Sākiyan kings.<br>With the king’s leave, Asita renounced the world and lived in the king’s pleasance. In due course he developed various iddhi powers. Thenceforward he would often spend the day in the deva worlds. Once, while in Tāvatimsa, he saw the whole city decked with splendour and the gods engaged in great rejoicing. On inquiry he learnt that Siddhattha Gotama, destined to become the Buddha, had been born. Immediately he went to Suddhodana’s home and asked to see the babe. From the auspicious marks on its body he knew that it would become the Enlightened One and was greatly overjoyed, but realising that he himself would, by then, be born in an Arūpa world and would not therefore be able to hear the Buddha preach, he wept and was sad. Having reassured the king regarding the babe’s future, Asita sought his sister’s son, Nalaka, and ordained him that he might be ready to benefit by the Buddha’s teaching when the time came. Later Asita was born in the Arūpa world (Sn., pp.131-36; SnA.ii.483ff.; J.i.54f).<br>According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.483), Asita was so-called because of his dark complexion. He also had a second name, Kanha Devala (SnA.ii.487). Other names for him were Kanha Siri (Sn.v.689), Siri Kanha (SnA.487) and Kāla Devala (J.i.54).<br>He is evidently to be distinguished from Asita Devala, also called Kāla Devala.<br>The Lalita Vistara has two versions of Asita’s prophecy, one in prose and one in verse, which, in their chief details, differ but slightly from the Pāli version. In the former his nephew is called Naradatta, and Asita himself is represented as being a great sage dwelling in the Himālaya but unknown to Suddhodana.<br>Here is evidently a confusion of his story with that of Asita Devala. In the Mahāvastu version (ii.30f) he is spoken of as the son of a brahmin of Ujjeni, and he lives in a hermitage in the Vindhyā mountains. It is noteworthy that in the Jātaka version he is called, not an isi, but a tāpasa, an ascetic practising austerities. And there we are told that when the king brought the boy, the future Buddha, and prepared to make him do reverence to the ascetic, the babe’s feet turned up and placed themselves on the ascetic’s head. For there is no one fit to be reverenced by a Bodhisatta, and had they put the babe’s head at the feet of the ascetic, the ascetic’s head would have split into seven pieces.<br>The tāpasa could see forty kappas into the past and forty kappas into the future. J.i.54-5. See Thomas, op. cit., pp.38 ff., on the growth of the Asita legend.<br>2. Asita.-A Pacceka Buddha, mentioned in a list of Pacceka Buddhas (M.iii.70; ApA.i.107).<br>3. Asita.-A garland-maker in the time of Sikhī Buddha. While taking a garland to the palace, he saw the Buddha and offered it to him. As a result, twenty-five kappas ago he became a king named Dvebhāra. In the present age he was known as Sukatāveliya Thera (Ap.i.217).'],
'asita devala':['1. Asita Devala.-A sage (isi). His story is given in theAssalāyana Sutta (M.ii.154ff). Once there were seven brahmin sages living in thatched cabins in the wilds. They conceived the view that the brahmins are the highest class of men and that they alone are the legitimate sons of Brahma. Hearing of this, Asita Devala appeared before their hermitage in orange attire, with stout sandals and staff, and shouted for them. The brahmins cursed him with the intention of shrivelling him into a cinder, but the more they cursed the more comely and handsome grew Asita. Feeling that their austerities were evidently fruitless, they questioned Asita who urged them to discard their delusion. Having learnt his identity, they saluted him and wished to be instructed; Asita examined and cross-questioned them about their pretensions regarding their lineage and they could find no answer. They thereupon followed his advice and renounced their claims to superiority.<br>Buddhaghosa says that Asita Devala was the Bodhisatta. MA.ii.785.<br>2. Asita Devala.-More commonly called Kāla Devala, probably identical with (1) above, and mentioned in the Indriya Jātaka (J.iii.463ff). He was one of the seven chief disciples of the Bodhisatta Sarabhaṅga and lived with many thousand sages in Avanti Dakkhināpatha. He had a younger brother Nārada, also an ascetic, who lived in Arañjara. When Nārada became enamoured of a courtesan on the river-bank near Arañjara, Kāla Devala flew to him, and in due course brought Sālissara, Mendissara and Pabbatissara to admonish him. When they, too, failed in their efforts to convert Nārada, Kāla Devala brought the master of all sages, Sarabhaṅga, who with their help persuaded Nārada to give up his love.<br>In this present age Kāla Devala became Mahā Kaccana (J.iii.469).'],

One day the prince, becoming enamoured of a Candakinnarī, followed her, forsaking his wife. (The kinnarī’s name was Candā, see Candā 9). Asitābhū went to the Bodhisatta and, having developed various superhuman powers, returned to her hut. Brahmadatta, having failed in his quest, returned to the hut where he found his wife poised in mid-air uttering songs of joy over her newfound freedom. When she left, he lived in solitude till, at his father’s death, he succeeded to the throne.<br>The story was told in reference to a young girl, the daughter of a servitor of the two chief disciples.

The deputation of the Sangha went to Kītāgiri and made an order that the Assaji-Punabbasukā should no longer dwell there, but the latter, instead of obeying the injunction, abused the monks, accusing them of partiality, and not only departed from Kītāgiri, but also left the Order. When the matter was reported to the Buddha he had the Pabbājaniyakamma revoked (”because it had served no purpose”) (Vin.ii.9-13, 14, 15).<br>In the Dhammapada Commentary (ii.109) we are told that Assaji and Punabbasu had originally been disciples of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, and that when the two Aggasāvakas admonished them and their followers on the wickedness of their conduct, some of them reformed themselves and a few retired to the householder’s life.<br>The Assaji-Punabbasukas seem to have had a special dislike for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Once the Buddha, on his way somewhere from Sāvatthi, accompanied by Sāriputta, Moggallāna and five hundred others, sent word to the Assaji-Punabbasukas to prepare sleeping places for them. They sent answer that the Buddha was very welcome, but not Sāriputta and Moggallāna, because ”they were men of sinful desires and influenced by such desires.” (Vin.ii.171)<br>But elsewhere (Kītāgiri Sutta, M.i.473ff) even the Buddha is represented as having been lightly regarded by them. When it was reported to them that the Buddha lived on only one meal a day and found that it made him well and healthy, their reply was that they themselves ate in the evening and the early morning and at noon and outside prescribed hours, and that they found this quite agreeable and saw no reason for changing their mode of life. It is true, however, that even on this occasion when the Buddha sent for them, they came dutifully and listened patiently to his admonition on the necessity of implicit obedience to a teacher in whom they had faith, and we are told that they were ”even gladdened in their hearts” after hearing the Buddha. There is, however, no evidence that they reformed after hearing him.<br>In the Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.525) the Assaji-Punabbasukā are mentioned as an example of those who paid no heed to precepts great or small, which they had undertaken to observe.<br>The Samantapāsādikā (iii.614) mentions that Kītāgiri was chosen by them as residence because it was watered by both monsoons, produced three crops, and had suitable sites for buildings.<br>They were five hundred in number.<br>assaji<br>1. Assaji TheraThe fifth of the Pañcavaggiya monks. When the Buddha preached theDhammacakkappavattana Sutta, he was the last in whom dawned the eye of Truth, and the Buddha had to discourse to him and to Mahānāma while their three colleagues went for alms (Vin.i.13. He became asotāpanna on the fourth day of the quarter, AA.i.84). He became an arahant, together with the others, at the preaching of the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta (Vin.i.14; J.i.82).<br>He was responsible for the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Sāriputta, in the course of his wanderings in search of Eternal Truth, saw Assaji begging for alms in Rājagaha, and being pleased with his demeanour, followed him till he had finished his round. Finding a suitable opportunity, Sāriputta asked Assaji about his teacher and the doctrines he followed. Assaji was at first reluctant to preach to him, because, as he said, he was but young in the Order. But Sāriputta urged him to say what he knew, and the stanza which Assaji uttered then, has, ever since, been famous, as representing the keynote of the Buddha’s teaching:<br>”ye dhammā hetuppabhavā tesam hetum Tathāgato āha tesañ ca yo nirodho, evamvādī Mahāsamano.”<br>Sāriputta immediately understood and hurried to give the glad tidings to Moggallāna that he had succeeded in his quest. Vin.i.39ff.; the incident is related in the DhA (i.75ff.) with slight variations as to detail.<br>Sāriputta held Assaji in the highest veneration, and we are told that from the day of this first meeting, in whatever quarter he heard that Assaji was staying, in that direction he would extend his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent supplication, and in that direction he would turn his head when he lay down to sleep (DhA.iv.150-1).<br>One day when Assaji was going about in Vesāli for alms, the Nigantha Saccaka, who was wandering about in search of disputants to conquer, saw him, and questioned him regarding the Buddha’s teaching because he was a well-known disciple (ñātaññatara-sāvaka). Assaji gave him a summary of the doctrine contained in theAnattalakkhaṇa Sutta. Feeling sure that he could refute these views attributed to the Buddha, Saccaka went with a large concourse of Licchavis to the Buddha and questioned him. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Cula-Saccaka Sutta (M.i.227ff). The Commentary (MA.i.452) tells us that Assaji decided on this method of exposition because he did not wish to leave Saccaka any loophole for contentious questioning.<br>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.iii.124ff) records a visit paid by the Buddha to Assaji as he lay grievously sick in Kassapārāma near Rājagaha. He tells the Buddha that he cannot enter into jhāna because of his difficulty in breathing and that he cannot win balance of mind. The Buddha encourages him and asks him to dwell on thoughts of impermanence and non-self.<br>2. Assaji.-One of the leaders of theAssaji-Punabbasukā, the other beingPunabbasu.

'assalāyana':['A young brahmin, sixteen years old, of Sāvatthi, very learned in the Vedas and allied subjects. Five hundred brahmins staying in the city asked him to hold a discussion with the Buddha and refute his views. He agreed only after repeated requests, because, he said, Gotama was a thinker with views of his own and, therefore, difficult to defeat in controversy.<br>He visits the Buddha and asks what he has to say concerning the claims of the brahmins to be the only superior class, the legitimate sons of Brahma.<br>The Buddha points out to him that such pretensions are baseless, and that virtue, which alone leads to purity, can be cultivated by any of the four classes. Assalāyana sits silent and upset at the end of the discourse, but when the Buddha relates to him a story of the past where Asita Devala had defeated brahmins who held these same views, Assalāyana feels relieved and expresses his admiration of the Buddha’s exposition. He declares himself a follower of the Buddha (M.ii.147ff). Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.785) tells us further that Assalāyana became a devoted follower of the faith and built a cetiya in his own residence for worship, and that all his descendants, down to Buddhaghosa’s day, built similar cetiyas in their houses.<br>Assalāyana is probably to be identified with the father of Mahākotthita, his wife being Candavati. There is, however, one difficulty connected with this theory: Mahākotthita says that he was won over to the faith after hearing the same sermon of the Buddha as converted his father (yadā me pitaram Buddho vinayī sabbasuddhiyā) (ThagA.i.31; Ap.ii.480). It is unlikely, if the identification be correct, that this refers to the Assalāyana Sutta, because at the time of that Sutta, Assalāyana was only sixteen years old; but there exists no record of any other sutta preached to Assalāyana, dealing with ”sabbasuddhi.”<br>Assalayāna’s name occurs in a list of eminent brahmins found in the Sutta-Nipāta Commentary (i.372).<br>Assalāyana Sutta.-Records the conversation between the Buddha and Assalāyana when the latter went to visit him.

They were the first teachers of the Tevijja Brahmins (D.i.238) and great sacrifices were conducted by them (A.iv.61).<br>Various teachings are attributed to them, e.g. that they recognised five kinds of Brahmins - brahmasama, devasama, mariyāda, sambhinnamariyāda, and brāhmanacandāla (A.iii.224ff). These sages did not claim to have discerned and realised the five qualities-truth, austerities, chastity, study and munificence - specified by the brahmins for the attainment of merit and the achievement of what is right (M.ii.199-200), though their followers behaved as if they did. Nor did they claim that they personally saw and knew that ”here alone resides the truth and everything else is vain.” (M.ii.169) In the Vimānavatthu Commentary it is said that the Buddha had realised those things of which these sages thought and for which they wished (p.265). (Brahmacintitan ti brahmehi Atthakādīhi cintitam, pañcacakkhunā dittham).<br>It is said that Atthaka and the other seers had the divine eye and had incorporated the teachings of Kassapa Buddha into their own scriptures.

For twelve years the ascetic lived in the park; then, desiring a change, he went away, and in the course of his wanderings, arrived at a ferry on the Ganges, where lived a foolish ferryman named Avāriyapitā. He took the Bodhisatta across, on the latter’s promising to tell him how to increase his wealth, his welfare and his virtue. On reaching the other side, the Bodhisatta advised the ferryman on the desirability of getting his fare before crossing if he wished to increase his wealth; he then proceeded to recite to him the stanzas on the virtue of compassion, which, for twelve years, he had daily recited to the king. Incensed at feeling that he had been cheated out of his money, the ferryman started striking the ascetic; his wife, coming along with his food, tried to stop him.

Being enraged at the loss of their food, the Yakkhas sent one of their number to the Bodhisatta. He came to the Bodhisatta’s bed at night meaning to strike him a deadly blow. Thereupon Sakka’s throne grew hot, and learning the cause, Sakka himself came and stood guard over the Bodhisatta. The latter saw the Yakkha standing over him ready to strike but powerless, and only learnt later, to his great encouragement, that Sakka had been there to protect him (J.iii.145-7).<br>The reason for the telling of the story is given in theMahākaṇha Jātaka.'],

When he was sixteen his father, wishing to give him the kingdom, had him taken in ceremonial procession round the city. Wondering at all that he saw, he asked why he had been denied the sight of all these things before. When told the reason, he reflected that all life was a prison, that though he had escaped the goblin, there still remained old age and death. Accordingly, at the end of the procession, he announced his intention of renouncing the world. His parents and many others being converted to his views, they followed him into the forest, where a special hermitage was built for them by Vissakamma under Sakka’s orders. J.iv.490-99.'],

Like an iron ball heated throughout the day, or a tuft of cotton seed on a ball of thistledown, wafted lightly on the wind, so the body, at such time, rises from the ground into the air and takes on manifold forms of magic power (S.v.282-4).'],
'ayojjhā':['1. Ayojjhā.-A city of the Ganges (but see below in this article).<br>Two visits of the Buddha to this city are recorded in the Samyutta Nikaya; on one occasion he preached the Phena Sutta (S.iii.140ff ) and on the other the Dārukkhandha Sutta (S.iv.179f). In both these references the city is said to be on the Ganges; the town usually called Ayojjhā (Ayodhya) is certainly not on this river. The records, therefore, go back either to a confused or an unintelligent tradition (see Thomas: op. cit., 15; cf. Sāketa), or may possibly refer to another settlement made by colonists from the original Ayojjhā. It is worthy of note that in the Dārukkhandha Sutta some of the MSS. read Kosambī for Ayojjhā. But even Kosambī was on the Jumnā and not on the Ganges.<br>During the Buddhist period, Ayojjhā on the Sarayū was the capital of Dakkhina Kosala, the janapada roughly corresponding to modern Oudh. This, the Ayodhyā of the Ramayana, is about a mile from the modern Fyzabad. In the Jātaka Commentary (J.iv.82) there is a mention of Ayojjhā, which here evidently refers to the city of the Sanskrit epics. It is called the capital of King Kālasena. It was besieged by the Andhaveṇhuputtā, who breached the wall and took the king prisoner. Having thus subjugated the city, they went to Dvāravatī.<br>It was twelve yojanas in length and ten in breadth. The Vindhatirthakalpa (ch.34), a Jaina work, also gives closely related measurements. There were in it spacious roads laid out in orderly fashion. The city contained theatres for females and gardens and mango groves and it was enclosed by a wall. In addition there was a deep moat round the city. The city abounded in brahmans and also fighting men (M.N.Dutt, Ramayana, trsl. I,18-19).<br>The two celebrated Chinese pilgrims Fa-hsien andHsuang-tsang, who came to India in the fifth and seventh century A.C., respectively, have recorded their visits to Ayojjha. When Fa-hsien visited it the Buddhists and the brahmans there were not on good terms. There was a stupa to commemorate the visits of the four Buddhas. Hsuan-tsang says that Ayojjha was a kingdom five-hundred li in circuit, and the capital about twenty li. It abounded in cereals and produced a large quantity of flowers and fruits. The climate was temperate and agreeable and the manners of the people were virtuous and amiable. They loved the duties of religion and diligently devoted themselves to learning. There were about a hundred monasteries in the country and about three thousand monks who studied the books of both Mahayana and Hinayana. There were ten deva-temples; heretics of different schools were found in them, but few in number. Vasubandhu wrote many treatises while residing here and explained Buddhism to princes and monks who used to come from other countries. Asaṅga, too, was a resident of Ayojjha Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, Vol. II, 247 ff.).<br>The Dīpavamsa (iii.15) mentions Ayujjhanagara as the capital of King Arindama and of fifty-five of his descendants.<br>According to Buddhaghosa (SA.ii.233-4), the people of Ayujjhanagara built for the Buddha a vihāra in a spot surrounded by forest near a curve of the river. Once a warrior named Jagatipāla, of the race of Rāma, came to Ceylon from Ayojjhā, and having slain Vikkamapaṇḍu, the heir-apparent to the throne, ruled in Rohana for five years. Cv.lvi.13ff.<br>2. Ayojjhā.-Capital of Siam. From there Vijayarājasīha, King of Ceylon, obtained monks for his own country (Cv.xcviii.91f).

Once he saw a merchant trying to get his five hundred carts across a ford; the merchant’s bulls were not strong enough for the task, and seeing the Bodhisatta the merchant tried to make use of his services.

'ābhassara':['A Brahma-world where live radiant devas from whose bodies rays of light are emitted, like lightning. It belongs to the Rūpaloka and is in the plane of second jhāna (Abhs. v.3; Compendium 138, n.4). The devas living there subsist on joy (pītibhakkha) (S.i.114.; DhA.iii.258; J.vi.55).<br>Their span of life is two kappas and there is no guarantee that a person who has been born there may not later be reborn in an unhappy condition (A.ii.127; but see Abhs. v.6, where their life-span is given as eight kappas).<br>From time to time these devas utter shouts of joy saying ”aho sukham, aho sukham.” This sound is the best of sounds. These devas are completely enveloped in ease (sukhena abhisaññā parisaññā) (A.iii.202; D. iii.219).<br>Their world forms the third station of consciousness (viññānatthiti), they are of uniform body, but their perceptions are diverse (ekattakāyā nānat-tasaññino) (A.iv.40, 401; D.ii.69; D.iii.253).<br>During the periods of the development of the world many beings are born in the Abhassara realm and they are then called the highest of the devas, yet even they change their condition (A.v.60). In lists of devas (E.g., M.i.289) they are given below the Appamānābhā and above the Subhā.<br>Bodhisattas are sometimes born in the ābhassara world (AA.i.73; J.i.406, 473; M.i.329; , MA.i.553; SA.i.162), but they are never born in Arūpa worlds even when they have developed Arūpa-jhānas. Baka Brahmā was born in ābhassara after having passed through Vehapphala and Subhakinna, and it was then that he conceived the belief that he was eternal.<br>The Buddha visited him and convinced him of the error of his belief (J.iii.359). When the universe is dissolved after the lapse of a long epoch and is again evolved, beings are mostly born in the ābhassara world. When, sooner or later, the world begins to re-evolve (vivattati), the Brahmavimāna appears, but it is empty. Then some being or other, either because he has finished his life there or because his merit is exhausted, leaves the ābhassara world and is reborn in the Brahmavimāna. Others follow his example, and it is then that the first to be reborn in the Brahma-world thinks of himself as Brahmā, the eternal, etc. (D.iii.29).<br>When inhabitants of the ābhassara-world are reborn as humans, their existence continues to be like that which they had in the brahma-world itself. As time goes on, however, they lose their qualities and develop the characteristics, both physical and mental, of human beings (For details see D.iii.84ff., PsA.253). Buddhaghosa (DA.iii.865) says that their birth on earth is opapātika (by spontaneous regeneration) and they are mind-born (manomaya).<br>On the occasions when the world is destroyed by fire, the fire spread up to the ābhassara-world; when by water, the water rises to the Subhakinna; when by wind, the wind reaches to the Vehapphala (CypA.9).<br>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.i.29; VibhA.520; cp. DA.ii.510), the ābhassaras are so called because radiance spreads from their bodies in all directions, like flames from a torch (dandadīpikāya acci viya etesam sarīrato ābhā chijjitvā chijjitvā patantī viya sarati visaratī ti Abhassarā).<br>According to the scholiast of the Candābha Jātaka (q.v.), beings who meditate on the Sun and Moon are born in this world. The Moon appears at the wish of the Abhassara Brahmās. See Candimā.'],

'ācāmadāyikā':['A family in Rājagaha was afflicted with plague and all its members died except one woman. She broke through a wall (that being the customary method of avoiding infection) and went and lived in the backyard of another house.

Having nothing but rice-water to give him, she asked him to go elsewhere, but the Elder showed his desire to accept her gift and refused alms offered to him by Sakka and by the inmates of the house behind which the woman lived.<br>With great joy she gave him the rice-water, and the Elder then told her that three births earlier she had been his mother.

The Vimanavatthu Commentary (p.116) says that ādicca (the Sun) belonged to the Gotamagotta, as did also the Buddha, hence his epithet ādiccabandhu; other explanations are given in the same context: the Buddha is born in the same ariyā jāti and is the descendant of the Sun (tam paticca tassa ariyāya jātiya jātattā), or the Sun is the Buddha’s kinsman because the Sun is the Buddha’s orasaputta (breast-born son) inasmuch as the Sun is the Buddha’s disciple. It is in this sense that in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.57) the Buddha speaks of the sun as ”mama pajā,” which Buddhaghosa (SA.i.86) explains as meaning disciple and spiritual son.<br>ādicca is described as tapatam mukham (chief of heat-producing things).

He himself observed all holy days and gave great gifts in charity. One day he offered flowers to the eastern quarter, and making obeisance, wished that any Pacceka Buddha in that quarter might come to accept his alms. His wish not being fulfilled, he repeated, on the following days, the same ceremony to the other quarters till, on the fourth day, seven Pacceka Buddhas came to him from the north where they lived in Nandamūlapabbhāra. The king and queen fed them for seven days and gave them robes and all the other requisites of an ascetic. The Pacceka Buddhas departed one by one, each expressing his thanks in a stanza and exhorting the king and queen to lead pure lives.<br>The story was related in reference to Pasenadi’s Asadisadāna, to show that wise men of old also gave gifts to holy men, with discretion (J.iii.469-74).<br>This is evidently the story referred to as the Sucira Jātaka in the introduction to the Dasa Brāhmana Jātaka (J.iv.360) and again as the Sovīra Jātaka in the introductory story of the Sivi Jātaka (J.iv.401).'],

On his way back, seeing the Pacceka Buddha returning with the excellent food from the merchant’s house in his alms-bowl, he wished he had distributed it among his own servants instead, as they would have done some work in return (J.iii.199-300).<br>The reason for āgantuka being heirless is related in the Mayhaka Jātaka.'],

Having learnt it he left the forest and was walking along the banks of the Yamunā, when he came across a host of Nāgas, sitting, after their sports, round the Nāga gem which grants all desires. The Nāgas, hearing the man repeat the charm, fled in terror, believing him to be the Garuda, and he took possession of their jewel. Soon after, ālambāyana met an outcast brahmin with his son, Somadatta, and on their agreeing to show him the Nāga King, Bhūridatta, he gave them the jewel.<br>With the help of his spell ālambāyana tamed Bhūridatta and went about giving exhibitions of the Nāga’s skill.

Once when one of the monks was cutting down a tree which was the abode of a devata, the sprite was sorely tempted to kill him, but restraining her wrath she sought the Buddha and complained to him. The Buddha praised her forbearance and preached the Uraga Sutta (SnA.i.4-5).<br>In the introductory story of the Manikantha Jātaka (J.ii.282-3) it is stated that the importunities of these monks so annoyed the residents of āḷavī that they fled at the approach of any yellow-robed monk.'],

In the sixteenth year after the Enlightenment, the Buddha spent the whole of the rainy season at āḷavī and preached the doctrine to 84,000 listeners (BuA.3). The King of āḷavī was known asāḷavaka and the inhabitants as āḷavaka. The town later became famous as the residence of āḷavaka Yakkha and ofHaṭṭhaka āḷavaka. The Therī,Selā was born in āḷavī and was therefore known as Alavikā (ThigA.62-3). There was evidently a large community of monks at āḷavī, some of whom seem to have chiefly occupied themselves with building vihāras for themselves (See āḷavakā).<br>Once, while at Sāvatthi, the Buddha saw a poor farmer of āḷavī, ready for conversion and decided to go and preach in that town. The farmer’s ox had strayed away, and he looked for it for quite a long while before finding it; he knew that the Buddha was in āḷavī and decided that he still had time to visit the Buddha, and he set off without taking any food. Meanwhile at āḷavī the Buddha and his monks had been served with a meal by the people, but the Buddha waited until the farmer came before returning thanks. On the farmer’s arrival the Buddha ordered that some food should be given him, and when the man was comforted and his mind was ready the Buddha preached a sermon, at the end of which the man became a Sotāpanna (DhA.iii.262-3).<br>On another occasion the Buddha came all the way fromJetavana to āḷavī for the sake of a weaver’s daughter. (For the story see DhA.iii.170f).<br>āḷavī has been identified by Cunningham and Hoernle with Newal or Nawal in the Urao district in the United Provinces, and by Nandalal Dey, with Aviwa, twenty-seven miles north-east of Etwah (Law: Geog, of. Early Buddhism, p.24).<br>Mrs. Rhys Davids states that āḷavī was on the bank of the Ganges (Ps. of the Brethren, 408), probably basing her view on the declaration of āḷavaka in the Sutta Nipāta (p.32) that he would throw the Buddha ”pāra-Gangāya” (over to the other side of the Ganges) unless his questions were answered. I believe that here ”pāra-Gangāya” is merely a rhetorical expression and has no geographical significance.'],
'ālāhanaparivena':['One of the religious buildings constructed in Pulatthipura by Parakkamabāhu I.<br>Attached to it was a splendid pāsāda for the thera Sāriputta (Cv.lxxviii.48-9).<br>Geiger (Cv.Trs.ii.107, n.2) identifies this with the group of buildings lying outside the city, now popularly, but wrongly, called the Jetavanārāma.'],
'āḷāra':['See Alāra.'],
'āḷāra kālāma':['One of the two teachers to whom Gotama, after his reṇunciation, first attached himself, the other beingUddaka Rāmaputta. In the Milindapañha (p.236) Ālāra is mentioned as Gotama’s fourth teacher. The ThigA. (p.2) says he went to Bhaggava before going to Ālāra. The Mtu. (ii.117f.) and the Lal. (330f), give quite different accounts.<br>In the Ariyaparivesāna Sutta (M.i.163-5; also 240ff; ii.94ff, 212ff) the Buddha describes his visit to Ālāra. Gotama quickly mastered his doctrine and was able to repeat it by heart; but feeling sure that Ālāra not only knew the doctrine but had realised it, he approached him and questioned him about it. Ālāra then proclaimed the ākiñcaññāyatana (sphere of nothingness, see jhāna 7), and Gotama, putting forth energy and concentration greater than Ālāra’s, made himself master of that state. Ālāra recognised his pupil’s eminence and treated him as an equal, but Gotama, not having succeeded in his quest, took leave of Ālāra to go elsewhere (VibhA.432). When, after having practised austerities for six years, the Buddha attained Enlightenment and granted Sahampati’s request to preach the doctrine, it was of Ālāra he thought first as being the fittest to hear the teaching. But Ālāra had died seven days earlier (Vin.i.7).<br>The books mention little else about Ālāra. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (D.16; Vsm.330) mentions a Mallian, Pukkusa, who says he had been Ālāra’s disciple, but who, when he hears the Buddha’s sermon, confesses faith in the Buddha. Pukkusa describes Ālāra to the Buddha as one who practised great concentration. Once Ālāra was sitting in the open air and neither saw nor heard five hundred passing carts though he was awake and conscious.<br>As already stated above, the aim of Ālāra’s practices is stated to have been the attainment of Akiñcaññayatana, the stage of nothingness. Whether this statement is handed down with any real knowledge of the facts of his teaching, it is not now possible to say. Asvaghosa, in his Buddhacarita (xii.17ff), puts into the mouth of Ārāda or Ālāra, a brief account of his philosophy. It has some resemblance - though this is slight - to the Sānkhya philosophy, but in Ālāra’s teaching some of the salient characteristics of the Sānkhya system are absent. In reply to Gotama’s questions about the religious life and the obtaining of final release, Ālāra describes a system of spiritual development which is identical with the methods of the Buddhist monk up to the last attainment but one. The monk reaches the four jhānas and then attains successively to the states of space, infinity and nothingness. The last three stages are described in the terms of the first three of the four Attainments. (For a discussion on this see Thomas, op. cit., p.229-30; see also MA.ii.881; VibhA.432).<br>According to Buddhaghosa (AA.i.458), Bharandu Kālāma was a disciple of Ālāra at the same time as Gotama and is therefore described as the Buddha’s purāṇa-sabrahmacārī (A.i.277). Buddhaghosa further tells us (DA.ii.569) that in Ālāra Kālāma, Ālāra was his personal name. He was so called because he was dīgha-piṅgala (long and tawny).'],
'āligāma':['A stronghold in the Ālisāra district on the banks of the modern Ambaṅganga. Here Parakkamabāhu&#39;s forces fought a decisive battle with those of Gajabāhu. Cv.lxx.113ff, and Geiger&#39;s note thereon in the Cv.Trs.i.296, n.4.'],
'ālisāra':['1. ālisāra.-A district in Ceylon, now Elahera in the Matale district, north-east of Nālanda on the Ambaṅganga. Once the whole district was given over by Vijayabāhu for the support of the monks of Pulatthipura (Cv.lx.14, and Geiger’s note thereon in the Cv.Trs.i.215, n.6). Later the district was the scene of several fights between the forces of Gajabāhu and Parakkamabāhu I.

'ālokalena':['A cave in the cleft of a mighty primeval landslide, not far from the modern Matale in Ceylon. According to tradition it was here that the Buddhist scriptures were first reduced to writing in Ceylon under the patronage of a chieftain of King Vattagāmāni. The Burmese believe that Buddhaghosa’s Atthakathās were also written in this spot (Mhv.xxiii.100f. See PLC.43f). In the eighteenth century King Vijayarājasīha built images of the Buddha in the rock cave. Cv.xcviii.65.'],
'āluvadāyaka thera':['An arahant. Thirty-one kappas ago he gave an āluva (fruit?) to the Pacceka Buddha Sudassana, near Himavā. Ap.i.237.'],
'āmagandha':['A brahmin. Before the appearance of the Buddha in the world, āmagandha became an ascetic and lived in the region of the Himālaya with five hundred pupils. They ate neither fish nor flesh. Every year they came down from their hermitage in search of salt and vinegar, and the inhabitants of a village near by received them with great honour and showed them every hospitality for four months.<br>Then one day the Buddha, with his monks, visited the same village, and the people having listened to his preaching became his followers. That year when āmagandha and his disciples went as usual to the village, the householders did not show towards them the same enthusiasm as heretofore. The brahmin, enquiring what had happened, was full of excitement on hearing that the Buddha had been born, and wished to know if he ate ”āmagandha,” by which he meant fish or flesh. He was greatly disappointed on learning that the Buddha did not forbid the eating of āmagandha, but, desiring to hear about it from the Buddha himself, he sought him at Jetavana. The Buddha told him that āmagandha was not really fish or flesh, but that it referred to evil actions, and that he who wished to avoid it should abstain from evil deeds of every kind. The same question had been put to the Buddha Kassapa by an ascetic named Tissa, who later became his chief disciple. In giving an account of the conversation between Kassapa Buddha and Tissa, the Buddha preached to āmagandha the āmagandha Sutta. The Brahmin and his followers entered the Order and in a few days became arahants. Sn., pp.42-5; SnA.i.278ff.<br>āmagandha Sutta.-The conversation between the Buddha and the brabmin āmagandha mentioned above (Sn.42ff). According to Buddhaghosa (SnA.i.280ff) this was merely a reproduction of the conversation of the Buddha Kassapa with the ascetic Tissa, who later became his chief disciple.<br>The sutta is particularly interesting as being one of the few passages in which sayings of the previous Buddhas are recorded. The Buddha’s view is put forward as being identical with that which had been enunciated long ago, with the intended implication that it was a self-evident proposition accepted by all the wise.'],
'āmakadhañña-peyyala':['The ninth chapter of the Sacca Samyutta of the Samyutta Nikāya. It contains a list of the gifts which Ariyan monks abstain from accepting. S.v.470-3.'],
'āmandagāmaṇī abhaya':['Son of Mahādāṭhika and King of Ceylon for nine years and eight months.

To the whole brotherhood of monks in the island he once gave robes and alms-bowls filled with kumbhaṇḍaka fruits (pumpkins) and thereafter he was known by the name of āmandagāmaṇī (āmanda is evidently a synonym of Kumbhaṇḍaka).<br>His brother Kanirajānu-Tissa, having killed him, succeeded to the throne (Mhv.xxxv.1-10; MT.640). āmandagāmaṇī is also referred to as āmanda and Amandiya.'],
'āmandaphaladāyaka thera':['An arahant. In a previous birth, while carrying a pingo laden with fruit, he saw the Buddha Padumuttara and offered him an āmanda fruit (pumpkin?). In the present age he became an arahant. Ap.ii.459.'],
'ānaka':['A mutinga (kettle-drum) belonging to the Dasārahas. As it grew old and began to split, they fixed in another peg, and this process was continued, until, at last, the original drumhead vanished, leaving only the framework of pegs (S.ii.266). The origin of the drum is related in the Kakkata Jātaka. When the Golden Crab, there mentioned, was trampled to death by the elephants, his two claws broke away from his body and lay apart in the Kulīradaha, where he lived. During the floods the water flowed from the Ganges into this lake, running back again when the floods subsided. The two claws were thus carried into the Ganges. One of them reached the sea, and the Asuras, picking it up, made thereof the drum named āḷambara. The other was picked up by the Ten Royal Brothers (evidently the Dasārahas mentioned above) while playing in the river, and they made of it the little drum ānaka (J.ii.344; the Jātaka is quoted in SA.ii.167-8, with several variations in detail).<br>In the Samyutta Commentary (ii.167-8) it is said that the drum was like molten wag in colour, because the crab’s claw had been dried by wind and sun. The sound of the drum was heard for twelve leagues, and it was, therefore, used only on festive occasions. On hearing it, the people assembled hurriedly, in various conveyances, decked with splendour. It was called ānaka because it brought the people together as if summoning them (mahājanam pakkositvā viya ānetī ti ānako).<br>Later, when the original drumhead had vanished, it could hardly be heard even inside a hall.<br>The ānaka drum is used as a simile in the āni Sutta (S.ii.266-7; see also KS.ii.178, n.4).'],
'ānanda':['Preached at Jetavana. ānanda discourses to the assembled monks on the nature of the True Saint- (Bhaddekaratta). The Buddha appears on the scene and on being told of ānanda’s discourse, asks him how exactly he had proceeded. ānanda repeats to him the Bhaddekaratta Sutta, which he had previously learnt from the Buddha.<br>The Buddha recites it himself from beginning to end and praises ānanda for his skill. M.iii.189-91.<br>ānanda<br>1. Ānanda.-One of the principal disciples of theBuddha. He was a first cousin of the Buddha and was deeply attached to him.<br>He came to earth from Tusita and was born on the same day as the Bodhisatta, his father being Amitodana the Sākiyan, brother of Suddhodana.Mahānāma andAnuruddha were therefore his brothers (or probably step-brothers). According to the Mtu.iii.176, Ānanda was the son of Suklodana and the brother of Devadatta and Upadhāna. His mother was Mrgī.<br>Ānanda entered the Order in the second year of the Buddha’s ministry, together with other Sākiyan princes, such as Bhaddiya, Anuruddha,Bhagu, Kimbila and Devadatta, and was ordained by the Buddha himself (Vin.ii.182), his upajjhāya being Belatthasīsa (ThagA.i.68; also DA.ii.418ff.; Vin.i.202; iv. 86). Soon after, he heard a discourse by Punna Mantāniputta and became a Sotāpanna. In S.iii.105 Ānanda acknowledges his indebtedness to Punna and gives an account of Punna’s sermon to him.<br>During the first twenty years after the Enlightenment, the Buddha did not have the same personal attendants all the time. From time to time various monks looked after him, among them being Nāgasamāla,Nāgita, Upavāna, Sunakkhatta, the novice Cunda, Sāgata, Rādha and Meghiya. We are told that the Buddha was not particularly pleased with any of them. At the end of twenty years, at an assembly of the monks, the Buddha declared that he was advanced in years and desired to have somebody as his permanent body-servant, one who would respect his wishes in every way. The Buddha says that sometimes his attendants would not obey him, and on certain occasions had dropped his bowl and robe and gone away, leaving him.<br>All the great disciples offered their services, but were rejected by the Buddha. Ānanda alone was left; he sat in silence. When asked why he did not offer himself, his reply was that the Buddha knew best whom to choose. When the Buddha signified that he desired to have Ānanda, the latter agreed to accept the post on certain conditions. The Buddha was never to give him any choice food or garment (*) gotten by him, nor appoint for him a separate ”fragrant cell” (residence), nor include him in the invitations accepted by the Buddha. For, he said, if the Buddha did any of these things, some would say that Ānanda’s services to the Buddha were done in order to get clothes, good fare and lodging and be included in the invitations. Further he was to be allowed to accept invitations on behalf of the Buddha; to bring to the Buddha those who came to see him from afar; to place before the Buddha all his perplexities, and the Buddha was to repeat to him any doctrine taught in his absence. If these concessions were not granted, he said, some would ask where was the advantage of such service. Only if these privileges were allowed him would people trust him and realise that the Buddha had real regard for him. The Buddha agreed to the conditions.<br>(*) Ānanda did, however, accept one of the two robes given by Pukkusa the Mallan to the Buddha (D.ii.133); Buddhaghosa explains this by saying that Ānanda’s period of service had now come to an end, and also he wished to be free from the accusation that even after having served the Buddha for twenty-five years, the Buddha had never made him any gift. It is further stated that Ānanda offered the robe to the Buddha later (DA.ii.570).<br>Thenceforth, for twenty-five years (Thag.v.1039), Ānanda waited upon the Buddha, following him like a shadow, bringing him water and toothpick, washing his feet, accompanying him everywhere, sweeping his cell and so forth. By day he was always at hand, forestalling the Master’s slightest wish; at night, stout staff and large torch in hand, he would go nine times round the Buddha’s Gandha-kuti in order to keep awake, in case he were needed, and also to prevent the Buddha’s sleep from being disturbed.<br>The account here given is summarised from AA.i.159ff. and from ThagA.ii.121ff. On the boons see J.iv.96, where Ānanda had asked for boons in the past too. The Tibetan sources give a different and interesting version of Ānanda’s entry into the Order. See Rockhill: Life of the Buddha, 57-8.<br>Many examples are given of- Ānanda’s solicitude for the Buddha, particularly during the Buddha’s last days, as related in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta. Ānanda was the Buddha’s equal in age (having been born on the same day), and it is touching to read of this old and most devoted attendant ministering to his eminent cousin, fetching him water, bathing him, rubbing his body, preparing his bed, and receiving last instructions from him on various matters of importance. It is said that when the Buddha was ill, Ānanda became sympathetically sick (D.ii.99). He was aware of every change that occurred in the Buddha’s body. E.g., the brightening of his features after Janavasabha’s visit (D.ii.204); and the fading of his complexion just before death, which was apparent when the Buddha put on the robe given by Pukkusa (ibid., 133).<br>Once, when acting on the instructions of Devadatta, the royal mahouts let loose Nālāgiri, maddened with drink, on the Buddha’s path, so that he might trample the Buddha to death, Ānanda, seeing the animal rushing towards them, immediately took his stand in front of the Buddha. Three times the Buddha forbade him to do so, but Ānanda, usually most obedient, refused to move, and it is said that the Buddha, by his iddhi-power, made the earth roll back in order to get Ānanda out of the elephant’s path. \[J.v.335-6; it was in this connection that the Cūlahamsa Jātaka was preached to show that Ānanda had, in previous births also, renounced his life to save that of the Buddha; see also DhA.i.119. The Cullavagga account of the Nālāgiri incident makes no mention of Ānanda’s past (Vin.ii.195)\].<br>Sometimes, the extreme zealousness of Ānanda drew on him the Buddha’s rebuke - e.g., when he prepared tekatuka gruel (gruel with three kinds of pungent substances) for the Buddha when he was suffering from wind in the stomach. The gruel was prepared from food kept indoors and was cooked by Ānanda himself, indoors; this was against the rules (Vin.i.210-11), but Ānanda knew that the gruel would cure the Buddha.<br>Ānanda was most efficient in the performance of the numerous duties attached to his post. Whenever the Buddha wished to summon the monks or to send a message to anyone, it was to Ānanda that he entrusted the task. See, e.g., D.ii.199; 147; Vin.i.80; M.i.456.<br>He reported to the Buddha any news which he beard and thought interesting. E.g., the death of Nigantha Nātaputta, of which he learnt from Cunda Samanuddesa (D.iii.118; M.ii.244); also Devadatta’s conspiracy to harm the Buddha (Vin.ii.198).<br>Laymen and laywomen, wishing to give alms to the Buddha and the monks, would often consult him in their difficulties, and he would always advise them. E.g., the Andhakavinda Brāhmana (Vin.i.220-1); Roja the Malla (ibid., 248); see also ibid., 238f.<br>When the monks came to him expressing their desire to hear the Buddha preach, he did his best to grant their wish. E.g„ when the Buddha retired into the Pārileyya forest (S.iii.95; DhA.i.50f.).<br>Sometimes when Ānanda felt that an interview with the Buddha would be of use to certain people, he would contrive that the Buddha should talk to them and solve their doubts; thus, for instance, he arranged an interview for the Nigantha Saccaka (M.i.237) and the brahmins Sangārava and Rammaka (S.i.163; M.i.161). Similarly he took Samiddhi to the Buddha when he found that Samiddhi had wrongly represented the Buddha’s views (M.iii.208). When he discovered that Kimbila and a large number of other monks would greatly benefit if the Buddha would preach to them on ānāpānasati, he requested the Buddha that he should do so. (S.v.323). Ānanda’s requests were, however, not always granted. Once, for instance, though he asked the Buddha three times to recite the Pātimokkha, the Buddha refused to do so until an offending monk had been removed (Vin.ii.236f.).<br>Again, when at Vesāli, as a result of the Buddha’s talks to the monks on asubha, a large number of them, feeling shame and loathing for their bodies, committed suicide, Ānanda suggested to the Buddha that he might teach the monks some method by which they might obtain insight (aññā) (S.v.320f).<br>In order that people might still worship the Buddha when he was away on tour, Ānanda planted the Ānanda-Bodhi (q.v.).<br>Ānanda was, however, careful that people should not weary the Buddha unnecessarily. Even when he told the Buddha about the suicide of the monks (mentioned above), he was careful to wait till the Buddha had finished his fortnight’s solitude, because he had given orders that he should not be disturbed.<br>When Subhadda wanted to see the Buddha as he lay on his death-bed, Ānanda refused to let him in until expressly asked to do so by the Master (D.ii.149). That same day when the Mallas of Kusinārā came with their families to pay their last respects to the Buddha, Ānanda arranged them in groups, and introduced each group so that the ceremony might be gone through without delay (D.ii.148).<br>He often saved the Buddha from unpleasantness by preventing too pious admirers from trying to persuade the Buddha to do what was against his scruples. E.g., Bodhirājakumāra, when he asked the Buddha to walk over the carpets in his mansion, Kokanada (Vin.ii.128; M.ii.94).<br>Among Ānanda’s duties was the task of going round to put away anything which might have been forgotten by anyone in the congregation after hearing the Buddha preach (DhA.i.410).<br>Ānanda was often consulted by colleagues on their various difficulties. Thus we find Vangīsa (S.i.188; Thag.vers.1223-6) confiding to him his restlessness at the sight of women and asking for his advice. Among others who came to him with questions on various doctrinal matters were Kāmabhū (S.iv.165-6), Udāyi (S.v.166-8; A.iv.449), Channa (S.iii.133-4), and Bhadda (S.v.171-3; ThagA.i.474; he could not, however, be of use to his fellow celibate Bhandu). Nor were these consultations confined to his fellow-monks, for we find the brahmins Ghosita (S.iv.113) and Unnābha (S.v.272), the Licchavis Abhaya and Panditakumāraka (A.i.220), the paribbājakas Channa (A.i.215) and Kokanuda (A.v.196), the upāsikā Migasālā (A.iii.347, and again A.v.137), a householder of Kosambī (A.i.217) and Pasenadi Kosala (M.ii.112), all coming to him for enlightenment and instruction. It was on this occasion that Pasenadi presented Ānanda with a valuable piece of foreign material which had been sent to him by Ajātasattu.<br>Sometimes the monks, having heard a brief sermon from the Buddha, would seek out Ānanda to obtain from him a more detailed exposition, for he had the reputation of being able to expound the Dhamma (A.v.225; S.iv.93).<br>It is said that the Buddha would often deliberately shorten his discourse to the monks so that they might be tempted to have it further explained by Ānanda. They would then return to the Buddha and report to him Ānanda’s exposition, which would give him an opportunity of praising Ānanda’s erudition. MA.i.81; for such praise see, e.g., A.v.229. It is said that once when a certain landowner asked the Buddha how he could show honour to the Dhamma, the Buddha told him to show honour to Ānanda if he wished to honour the Dhamma (J.iv.369).<br>In the Sekha Sutta (M.i.353ff ) we are told that after the Buddha had preached to the Sākiyans of Kapilavatthu till late at night, he asked Ānanda to continue the discourse while he himself rested. Ānanda did so, and when the Buddha awoke after his sleep, he commended Ānanda on his ability. On another occasion, the Buddha asks Ānanda to address the monks on the wonders attendant on a Buddha’s birth, and the Acchari-yabbhuta-Dhamma Sutta is the result. The Buddha is mentioned as listening with approval (M.iii.119ff).<br>Sometimes Ānanda would suggest to the Buddha a simile to be used in his discourse, e.g. the Dhammayāna simile (S.v.5); or by a simile suggest a name to be given to a discourse, e.g. the Madhupindika Sutta (M.i.114; cp. Upavāna suggesting the name for the Pāsādika Sutta D.iii.141); or again, particularly wishing to remember a certain Sutta, he would ask the Buddha to give it a name, e.g. the Bahudhātuka Sutta (M.iii.67).<br>Several instances occur of Ānanda preaching to the monks of his own accord (E.g., A.ii.156f.; v.6) and also to the laity (E.g., A.ii.194). The Sandaka Sutta records a visit paid by Ānanda with his followers to the paribbajaka Sandaka, and describes how he won Sandaka over by a discourse. Sometimes, as in the case of the Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.189f ) Ānanda would repeat to the assembly of monks a sermon which he had previously heard the Buddha preach. Ānanda took the fullest advantage of the permission granted to him by the Buddha of asking him any question he desired. He had a very inquiring mind; if the Buddha smiled he would ask the reason (M.ii.45, 50, 74; A.iii.214f.; J.iii.405; iv.7).<br>Or if he remained silent, Ānanda had to be told the reason (S.iv.400). He knew that the Buddha did nothing without definite cause; when Upavāna, who stood fanning the Buddha, was asked to move away, Ānanda wished to know the reason, and was told that Upavāna prevented various spirits from seeing the Buddha (D.ii.139). The Buddha was always willing to answer Ānanda’s questions to his satisfaction. Sometimes, as in the case of his question regarding the dead citizens of Ñātikā (D.ii.91ff.),* a long discourse would result.**<br>* In this case the discourse concluded with a description of the Dhammādāsa (Mirror of Truth) to be used for all time; see also S.v.356-60.<br>** The Pabbajjā Sutta (Sn.72ff.), was preached because of Ānanda’s request that the Buddha should give an account of his reṇunciation (SnA.ii.381); see also Pubbayogāvacara Sutta (SnA.i.47).<br>Most often his consultations with the Buddha were on matters of doctrine or were connected with it - e.g., on nirodha (S.iii.24); loka (S.iv.53); suñña (S.iv.54; M.iii.104-24); vedanā (S.iv.219-21) ; iddhi (S.v.282-4; 286); ānāpānasati (S.v.328-34); bhava, etc. (A.i.223f.); on the chalabhijāti of Pūrana Kassapa (q.v.); the aims and purposes of sīla (A.v.1f., repeated in v.311f.); the possibilities of samādhi (A.v.7f., repeated in v.318 and in A.i.132f.); on saṅghabheda (A.v.75ff.); the qualities requisite to be a counsellor of monks (A.iv.279ff.); the power of carrying possessed by a Buddha’s voice (A.i.226f.); the conditions necessary for a monk’s happiness (A.iii.132f.); the different ways of mastering the elements (M.iii.62f.); the birthplace of ”noble men” (DhA.iii.248); and the manner in which previous Buddhas kept the Fast-day (DhA.iii.246). To these should be added the conversations on numerous topics recorded in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta. Some of these questions - e.g., about earthquakes (D.ii.107ff.; A.iv.312ff.) and the different kinds of spirits present at the death of the Buddha (D.ii.139f.) - seem to have been put into Ānanda’s mouth in order that they might be used as pegs on which to hang beliefs connected with them which were current among later-day Buddhists.<br>Not all the Suttas addressed to Ānanda are, however, the result of his questions. Sometimes he would repeat to the Buddha conversations he had had with others and talks he had overheard, and the Buddha would expound in detail the topics occurring therein.<br>Thus, for instance, a conversation with Pasenadi Kosala on Kalyānamittatā is repeated and the Buddha explains its importance (S.i.87-9; v.2-3) ; Ānanda tells the Buddha about his visit to the Paribbajakārāma in Kosambi and what he there heard about a bhikkhu being called niddasa after twelve years of celibacy. The Buddha thereupon expounds the seven niddasavatthu (A.iv.37ff.). The account conveyed by Ānanda of Udāyī preaching to a large crowd leads to an exposition of the difficulties of addressing large assemblies and the qualities needed to please them (A.iii.184). A conversation between Udāyī and the carpenter Pañcakaṅga on feelings is overheard by Ānanda and reported to the Buddha, who gives a detailed explanation of his views on the subject (S.iv.222f.; M.i.397f.). The same thing happens when Ānanda mentions to the Buddha talks he had heard between Sāriputta and the Pāribbājakas (S.ii.35-7) and between the same Elder and Bhūmiya (S.ii.39-41). Sometimes - as in the case of the upāsikā Migasālā (A.iii.347; v.137) - Ānanda would answer questions put to him as best he could, and seek the Buddha’s advice and corrections of his interpretation of the Doctrine.<br>When the monks asked Ānanda whether the Buddha’s predictions regarding the results of Devadatta’s crimes were based on actual knowledge, he furnished them with no answer at all until he had consulted the Buddha (A.iii.402). Similarly, when Tapussa questions him as to why household life is not attractive to laymen, Ānanda takes him straight away to the Buddha, who is spending his siesta in the Mahāvana in Uruvelakappa (A.iv.438f.). Once Ānanda fancies that he knows all about causation, and tells the Buddha how glad he is that he should understand this difficult subject. The Buddha points out to him that he really knows very little about it and preaches to him the Mahānidāna Sutta (D.ii.55ff.; S.ii.92-3).<br>When Ānanda realises that the Buddha will die in a short while, with childlike simplicity, he requests the Buddha to make a last pronouncement regarding the Order (D.ii.98 ff.; S.v.152-4).<br>On several occasions it is news that Ānanda brings to the Buddha - e.g., about the death of the Nigantha Nātaputta, and about Devadatta’s plots, already mentioned - which provoke the Buddha to preach to him: Phagguṇa has died, and at his death his senses seemed very clear; so they would, says the Buddha, and proceeds to speak of the advantages of listening to the Dhamma in due season (A.iii.381f.). Or again, Girimānanda is ill and would the Buddha go and see him? The Buddha suggests that Ānanda should go and tell Girimānanda about the ten kinds of saññā (aniccasññā, etc.), and the patient will recover (A.v.108f.). Ānanda desires to retire into solitude and develop zeal and energy; would the Buddha tell him on which topics to meditate? And the Buddha preaches to him the doctrine of impermanence (S.iii.187; iv.54-5).<br>The Buddha, however, often preached to Ānanda without any such provocation on various topics - e.g., on the nature of the sahkhāra (S.iii.3740); on the impossibility of the monk without faith attaining eminence in the sāsana (A.v.152ff.); on the power the Buddha has of knowing which doctrines would appeal to different people and of preaching accordingly (A.v.36f.); on immorality and its consequences (A.i.50f.); on the admonitions that should be addressed to new entrants to the Order (A.iii.138f.); on the advice which should be given to friends by those desiring their welfare (A.i.222).<br>The various topics on which the Buddha discoursed to Ānanda as recorded in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, have already been referred to. Some of them - e.g., on the eight assemblies, the eight positions of mastery, the eight stages of deliverance (D.ii.112) - seem to be stereotyped later additions. On the other hand, with regard to the accounts of the honours to be paid to a Buddha’s dead body, the places of pilgrimage for the pious, and various other similar subjects, it is impossible to say how far they are authentic. In a few instances the remarks addressed to Ānanda seem to be meant for others, to be heard by them or to be conveyed to them - e.g., in the dispute between Udāyī and Sāriputta, when they both seek the Buddha for him to settle the differences in opinion between them (A.iii.192ff.); or, again, when the recalcitrant Udāyī fails to answer the Buddha’s question on subjects of reflection (anussatitthāna), and Ānanda gives an answer which the Buddha approves (A.iii.322ff.). A question asked by Ānanda as to whether there are any scents which spread even against the wind, results in the well-known sermon about the fame of the holy man being wafted everywhere (A.i.222f.; DhA.i.420ff.). Once or twice Ānanda intervenes in a discussion between the Buddha and another, either to ask a question or to suggest a simile which he feels could help the Buddha in establishing his point - e.g., in the interviews of Uttiya Paribbājaka (A.v.194), of the brahmin Sangārava (A.i.169), and again of Vidūdabha, son of Pasenadi (M.ii.130).<br>In the Mahā Mālunkyā Sutta (M.i.433), it is Ānanda’s intervention which evokes the discourse on the Five Fetters. Similarly he intervenes in a discussion between the Buddha and Pārāsariya’s pupil, Uttara, and persuades the Buddha to preach the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta on the cultivation of the Faculties (M.iii.298ff.).<br>Buddhaghosa gives a list of the discourses which bring out the eminence and skill of Ānanda; they are the Sekha, Bāhitiya, ānañjasappāya, Gopaka-Moggallāna, Bahudhātuka, Cūlasuññata, Mahāsuññata, Acchariyabbhuta, Bhaddekaratta, Mahānidā-na, Mahāparinibbāna, Subha and Cūlaniyalokadhātu. (For particulars of these see under the respective names.) The books give accounts of several conversations between Ānanda and his eminent colleagues, such as Sāriputta. See also his conversation with Musīla, and Savittha and Nārada at Kosambī in the Ghositārāma (S.ii.113f.). He seems to have felt happy in their company and did not hesitate to take to them his difficulties; thus we find him asking Sāriputta why only certain beings in this world reach parinibbāna (A.ii.167); on another occasion he asks Sāriputta about the possibilities of samādhi (A.v.8). On the other hand, at least twice (A.iii.201f.; 361f.), when Ānanda asks his questions of Sāriputta, the latter suggests that Ānanda himself should find the answer, and having heard it, Sāriputta praises him highly and extols his abilities.<br>Ānanda’s special friends seem to have been Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Mahā Kassapa, Anuruddha and Kankhā Revata (E.g., M.i.212f). He was the Sangha-navaka among them all, yet they held him in high esteem (MA.i.436). Ānanda and Sāriputta were very special friends. It is said that Sāriputta loved Ānanda because the latter did for the Buddha what Sāriputta would wish to have done himself, and Ānanda respected Sāriputta because he was the Buddha’s chief disciple. Young men who were ordained by either of them would be sent to the other to learn under him. They shared between them any good thing given to them. Once Ānanda was presented by a brahmin with a costly robe; immediately he wished to give it to Sāriputta, but as the latter was away at the time, he obtained the Buddha’s permission to keep it for him till his return (Vin.i.289; Sp.iii.636-7; MA.i.436).<br>The Samyutta Nikāya (i.63-4) contains an eulogy on Sāriputta by Ānanda, where the latter speaks of his comprehensive and manifold wisdom, joyous and swift, of his rampant energy and readiness to accept advice. When he hears of Sāriputta’s death from Cunda the Samanuddesa, he goes to the Buddha with Cunda (not wishing to break the news himself) and they take with them Sāriputta’s bowl and outer robe, Cunda carrying the ashes, and there Ānanda confesses to the Buddha that when he heard the news he felt as thought his body were drugged, his senses confused and his mind become a blank (S.v.161; Thag.vers.1034-5). The Commentary adds (SA.i.180) that Ānanda was trembling ”like a cock escaping from the mouth of a cat.”<br>That Mahā Kassapa was fond of Ānanda, we may gather from the fact that it was he who contrived to have him elected on the First Council, and when Mahā Kassapa heard of Ānanda’s attainment of arahantship, it was he who led the applause (DA.i.11). Ānanda held him in the highest veneration, and on one occasion refused to take part in an upasampadā ordination because he would have to pronounce Kassapa’s name and did not consider this respectful towards the Elder (Vin.i.92). In their conversations, Kassapa addresses Ānanda as ”āvuso”, Ānanda addresses Kassapa as ”bhante.” There is an interview recorded between them in which Kassapa roundly abuses Ānanda, calling him- corn-trampler” and ”despoiler of families,” and he ends by up saying , this boy does not know his own measure.” Ānanda had been touring Dahkhinagiri with a large company of monks, mostly youths, and the latter had not brought much credit upon them selves. When Kassapa sees Ānanda on his return to Rājagaha, he puts on him the whole blame for the youths’ want of training. Ānanda winces at being called ”boy”; , my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence, yet I am not vexed that you should call me ’boy’ even at this time of day.” Thullanandā heard of this incident and showed great annoyance. ”How dare Mahā Kassapa,” she says, ”who was once a heretical teacher, chide the sage Ānanda, calling him ’boy’?” Mahā Kassapa complains to Ānanda of Thullanandā’s behaviour; probably, though we are not told so, Ānanda apologised to him on her behalf (S.ii.217ff).<br>On another occasion, Ānanda, after a great deal of persuasion, took Kassapa to a settlement of the nuns. There Kassapa preached to them, but the nun Thullatissā was not pleased and gave vent publicly to her displeasure. ”How does Kassapa think it fit to preach the doctrine in the presence of the learned sage Ānanda? It is as if the needle-pedlar were to deem he could sell a needle to the needle-maker.” Kassapa is incensed at these words, but Ānanda appeases him by acknowledging that he (Kassapa) is in every way his superior and asks him to pardon Tissa. ”Be indulgent, your reverence,” says he, ”women are foolish.” S.ii.215ff.; the Tibetans say that when Kassapa died, Ajātasattu was very grieved because he had not been able to see the monk’s body. Ānanda took the king to the mountain where it had been buried and showed it to him (Rockhill, op. cit., p.162 and n.2).<br>In this passage Ānanda is spoken of as Vedehamuni. The Commentary (SA.ii.132) explains it by paṇḍitamuni, and says further, pandito hi ñānasankhātena vedena īhati sabbakiccāni karoti, tasmā vedeho ti vuccati ; vedeho ca so muni cā ti vedehamuni. Compare with this the derivation of Vedehiputta in connection with Ajātasattu. See also Vedehikā. The Mtu. (iii.176-7) says that when the Buddha went away from home Ānanda wished to join him, but his mother was unwilling, because his brother, Devadatta, had already gone away. Ānanda therefore went to the Videha country and became a muni. Is this another explanation of the term Vedehamuni?<br>It was perhaps Ānanda’s championship of the women’s cause which made him popular with the nuns and earned for him a reputation rivalling, as was mentioned above, even that of Mahā Kassapa. When Pajāpatī Gotamī, with a number of Sākyan women, undaunted by the Buddha’s refusal of their request at Kapilavatthu, followed him into Vesāli and there beseeched his consent for women to enter the Order, the Buddha would not change his mind.<br>Ānanda found the women dejected and weeping, with swollen feet, standing outside the Kūtāgārasālā. Having learnt what had happened, he asked the Buddha to grant their request. Three times he asked and three times the Buddha refused. Then he changed his tactics. He inquired of the Buddha if women were at all capable of attaining the Fruits of the Path. The answer was in the affirmative, and Ānanda pushed home the advantage thus gained. In the end the Buddha allowed women to enter the Order subject to certain conditions. They expressed their great gratitude to Ānanda (Vin.ii.253ff. Ānanda is again found as intermediary for Pajāpatī Gotamī in M.iii.253f). In this connection, the Buddha is reported as having said (Vin.ii.256) that had Ānanda not persuaded him to give his consent to the admission of women to the Order, the Sāsana would have lasted a thousand years, but now it would last only five hundred.<br>This championing of the women’s cause was also one of the charges brought against Ānanda by his colleagues at the end of the First Council. (See below.)<br>Perhaps it was this solicitude for their privileges that prompted him to ask the Buddha one day why it was that women did not sit in public assemblies (e.g. courts of justice), or embark on business, or reap the full fruit of their actions (A.ii.82. See also GS.ii.92, n.2, on the interpretation of the last word).<br>That Ānanda was in the habit of preaching frequently to the nuns is evident from the incidents quoted above and also from other passages (E.g., S.v.154ff.; Thag.v.1020; ThagA.ii.129). He seems also to have been in charge of the arrangements for sending preachers regularly to the nuns. A passage in the Samyutta Commentary (i.210) seems to indicate that Ānanda was a popular preacher among laywomen as well.<br>They would stand round him when he preached, fanning him and asking him questions on the Dhamma. When he went to Kosambī to impose the higher penalty on Channa, the women of King Udena’s harem, hearing of his presence in the park, came to him and listened to his preaching. So impressed were they that they gave him five hundred robes (Vin.ii.290). It was on this occasion that Ānanda convinced Udena of the conscientiousness with which the Sākyaputta monks used everything which was given to them, wasting nothing. The king, pleased with Ānanda, gave him another five hundred robes, all of which he distributed among the community.<br>Ananda had been a tailor in a past birth and had given a Pacceka Buddha a piece of cloth, the size of his hand, and a needle. Because of the gift of the needle he was wise, because of the cloth he got 500 robes (AA.i.239).<br>A similar story is related of the women of Pasenadi’s palace and their gift to Ānanda. The king was at first angry, but afterwards gave Ānanda one thousand robes (J.ii.24ff).<br>The Dhammapada Commentary (i.382ff ) says that once Pasenadi asked the Buddha to go regularly to the palace with five hundred monks and preach the Law to his queens Mallikā and Vāsabhakhattiyā and to the other women in the palace. When the Buddha said that it was impossible for him to go regularly to one place he was asked to send a monk, and the duty was assigned to Ānanda. He therefore went to the palace at stated times and instructed the queens. Mallikā was found to be a good student, but not so Vāsabhakhattiyā.<br>The Jātaka Commentary (i.382) says that the women of the palace were themselves asked which of the eighty chief disciples they would have as their preacher and they unanimously chose Ānanda. For an incident connected with Ānanda’s visits to the palace see the Mahāsāra Jātaka and also Pasenadi.<br>According to the Anguttara Commentary (ii.533) Ānanda was beautiful to look at.<br>Ānanda’s services seem often to have been sought for consoling the sick. Thus we find Anāthapindika sending for him when he lay ill (M.iii.258), and also Sirivaddha (S.v.176f) and Mānadinna (S.v.177f). He is elsewhere mentioned as helping the Buddha to wait on a sick monk (Vin.i.302). We are told that when the Buddha had his afternoon siesta, Ānanda would spend his time in waiting upon the sick and talking to them (Sp.iii.651). Ānanda was never too busy to show gratitude to his friends. When a certain crow-keeper’s family, members of which had been of special service to him, had been destroyed by a pestilence, leaving only two very young boys, he obtained the Buddha’s special permission to ordain them and look after them, though they were under the requisite age. (Vin.i.79; to a young monk who used to wait on him and do various services for him, Ānanda gave five hundred robes presented to him by Pasenadi; the monk distributed them to his colleagues).<br>When Ānanda discovered that his friend Roja and Malla had no real faith in the Buddha, he was greatly grieved and interceded on his special behalf with the Buddha that he should make Roja a believer. Later he obtained the Buddha’s permission for Roja to offer a meal of potherbs (Vin.i.247-9). In another place we find Roja presenting Ānanda with a linen cloth (Vin.i.296). According to the Jātakaṭṭhakathā (ii.231) Roja once tried to persuade Ānanda to go back to the lay-life.<br>His sympathy is also shown in the story of the woman who asked to have a share in the Vihāra built by Visākhā. She brought a costly carpet, but could find no place in which to put it; it looked so poor beside the other furnishings. Ānanda helped her in her disappointment (DhA.i.415f).<br>Once in Jetavana, in an assembly of monks, the Buddha spoke the praises of Ānanda, and ranked him the foremost bhikkhu in five respects: erudition, good behaviour (gatimantānam, power of walking, according to Dhammapāla), retentive memory, resoluteness and personal attention (A.i.24f). Again, shortly before the Buddha’s death, he speaks affectionately of Ānanda (D.ii.144-5; A.ii.132; A.v.229; SA.ii.94f ); Ānanda knew the right time to bring visitors to the Tathāgata; he had four exceptional qualities, in that whoever came to see him, monks or nuns, laymen or laywomen, they were all filled with joy on beholding him; when he preached to them they listened with rapture and delight, which never tired. He was called Ānanda because he brought joy to his kinsmen (ThagA.ii.123).<br>But see the story of Atula (DhA.iii.327), who is not satisfied with Ānanda’s preaching.<br>Another proof of the Buddha’s esteem for Ānanda is the incident of his asking Ānanda to design a robe for the monks to be in pattern like a field in Magadha (Vin.i.287).<br>In spite of Ānanda having been the constant companion of the Buddha - probably because of that very fact - it was not until after the Buddha’s parinibbāna that Ānanda was able to realise Arahantship. Buddhaghosa gives a long account of Ānanda’s struggle for final emancipation (DA.i.9ff.); see also Vin.ii.286. Though he was not an arahant he had the patisambhidā, being among the few who possessed this qualification while yet learners (Sekhā) ( VibhA.388). When it was decided by Mahā Kassapa and others that a Convocation should be held to systematise the Buddha’s teachings, five hundred monks were chosen as delegates, among them, Ānanda. He was, however, the only non-arahant (sekha) among them, and he had been enjoined by his colleagues to put forth great effort and repair this disqualification. At length, when the convocation assembled, a vacant seat had to be left for him. It had not been until late the previous night that, after a final supreme effort, he had attained the goal. He had been occupied in consoling the laity after the Buddha’s death and had had no time for practising meditation. In the end it was a devatā in the woodland grove in Kosala, where he was staying, who pointed out the urgency of the matter (S.i.199-200); but see ThagA.i.237, where the credit for this is given to a Vajjiputta thera.<br>It is said that he won sixfold abhiññā when he was just lying down to sleep, his head hardly on the pillow, his feet hardly off the ground. He is therefore described as having become an arahant in none of the four postures. When he appeared in the convocation, Mahā Kassapa welcomed him warmly and shouted three times for joy. According to the Majjhimabhānakā, says Buddhaghosa, Ānanda appeared on his seat while the others looked on, having come through the earth; according to others he came through the air. According to ThagA.ii.130, it was a Brahmā of the Suddhāvāsa who announced Ānanda’s attainment of arahantship to his colleagues at the Convocation.<br>In the convocation, Ānanda was appointed to answer Mahā Kassapa’s questions, and to co-operate with him in rehearsing the Dhamma (as opposed to the Vinaya).<br>Ānanda came to be known as Dhammabhandāgārika, owing to his skill in remembering the word of the Buddha; it is said that he could remember everything spoken by the Buddha, from one to sixty thousand words in the right order; and without missing one single syllable (ThagA.ii.134).<br>In the first four Nikāyas of the Sutta Pitaka, every sutta begins with the words ”Thus have I heard,” the ”I” referring to Ānanda. It is not stated that Ānanda was present at the preaching by the Buddha of every sutta, though he was present at most; others, the Buddha repeated to him afterwards, in accordance with the conditions under which he had become the Buddha’s attendant.<br>We are told that Ānanda had learnt eighty-two thousand dhamma (topics) from the Buddha himself and two thousand from his colleagues (Thag.v.1024). He had also a reputation for fast talking; where an ordinary man could speak one word Ānanda could speak eight; the Buddha could speak sixteen words for each one word of Ānanda (MA.i.283). Ānanda could remember anything he had once heard up to fifteen thousand stanzas of sixty thousand lines (MA.i.501).<br>Ānanda lived to be very old (one hundred and twenty years, says DhA.ii.99; he is bracketed with Bakkula, as having lived to a great age, AA.ii.596); a hymn of praise sung at his death is included at the end of the stanzas attributed to him in the Theragāthā (Vers.1047-9). That the Buddha’s death was a great blow to him is shown by the stanzas he uttered immediately after the event (D.ii.157). Three months earlier he had heard for the first time that death of the Buddha was near at hand and had besought him to live longer. The reply attributed to the Buddha is a curious one, namely, that on several previous occasions, at Rājagaha and at Vesālī (See, e.g., D.102f), he had mentioned to Ānanda that he could, if he so desired, live for a whole kappa, and had hinted that Ānanda should, if he felt so inclined, request him to prolong his life. Ānanda, however, having failed to take the hint on these occasions, the opportunity was now past, and the Buddha must die; the fault was entirely Ānanda’s (Ibid., 114-18). It was when Ānanda was temporarily absent from the Buddha’s side that the Buddha had assured Māra that he would die in three months (Ibid., 105-6).<br>As the end approached, the Buddha noticed that Ānanda was not by his side; on enquiry he learnt that Ānanda was outside, weeping and filled with despair at the thought that the Master would soon be no more, and that he (Ānanda) would have to work out his perfection unaided. The Buddha sent for him and consoled him by pointing out that whatever is born must, by its very nature, be dissolved. Three times he said, ”For a long time, Ānanda, you have been very near to me by acts of love, kind and good, never varying, beyond all measure,” and he exhorted him to be earnest in effort, for he would soon realise emancipation. (Ibid., 144). It was on this occasion that the Palāsa Jātaka was preached (J.iii.23ff.).<br>Once, earlier, when Udāyi had teased Ānanda for not having benefited from his close association with the personality of the Master, the Buddha had defended Ānanda, saying, ”Say not so, Udāyi; should he die without attaining perfect freedom from passion, by virtue of his piety, he would seven times win rule over the devas and seven times be King of Jambudīpa. Howbeit, in this very life shall Ānanda attain to Nibbāna. A.i.228.<br>Ānanda did his best to persuade the Buddha to die in one of the great cities, such as Rājagaha or Sāvatthi, and not in Kusinārā, the little wattle-and-daub town (as he called it) in the middle of the jungle. He was not satisfied until the Buddha had revealed to him the past history of Kusinārā, how it had once been Kusāvatī, the royal capital of the mighty Mahā Sudassana (D.ii.146).<br>Just before the Buddha died, Ānanda was commissioned to inform the Mallas of the impending event, and after the Buddha’s death, Anuruddha entrusted him, with the help of the Mallas of Kusināāa, with all the arrangements for the funeral (D.ii.158ff). Ānanda had earlier (D.ii.141f) learnt from the Buddha how the remains of a Tathāgata should be treated, and now he was to benefit by the instruction.<br>At the end of the First Council, the duty of handing down unimpaired the Digha Nikāya through his disciples was entrusted to Ānanda (DA.i.15). He was also charged with the duty of conveying to Channa the news that the higher penalty (brahmadanda) had been inflicted on him by the Sangha. Ānanda had been deputed by the Buddha himself to carry out this, his last administrative act (D.ii.154), but Ānanda, not wishing to undertake the responsibility alone (knowing that Channa had a reputation for roughness), was granted a number of companions, with whom he visited Channa. The latter expressed repentance and was pardoned (Vin.ii.290-2). Perhaps it was because both the Buddha and Ānanda’s colleagues knew of his power to settle disputes that he was chosen for this delicate task. See S.ii.235f., where the Buddha classes him with Sāriputta and Moggallāna for his ability to settle disputes among the monks.<br>Ānanda’s popularity, however, did not save him from the recriminations of his fellows for some of his actions, which, in their eyes, constituted offences. Thus he was charged (Vin.ii.288-9) with: (1) having failed to find out from the Buddha which were the lesser and minor precepts which the Sangha were allowed to revoke if they thought fit (See D.ii.154); (2) with having stepped on the Buddha’s rainy-season garment when sewing it; (3) with having allowed the Buddha’s body to be first saluted by women (not mentioned elsewhere, but see Rockhill, op. cit., p.154); (4) with having omitted to ask the Buddha to live on for the space of a kappa (D.ii.115); and (5) with having exerted himself to procure the admission of women into the Order (Vin.ii.253).<br>Ānanda’s reply was that he himself saw no fault in any of these acts, but that he would confess them as faults out of faith in his colleagues.<br>On another occasion he was found fault with (1) for having gone into the village to beg for alms, clothed in his waist-cloth and nether garment (Vin.i.298); (2) for having worn light garments which were blown about by the wind (Vin.ii.136).<br>The last years of his life, Ānanda seems to have spent in teaching and preaching and in encouraging his younger colleagues. Among those who held discussions with him after the Buddha’s passing away are mentioned Dasama of the Atthakanagara (M.i.349f), Gopaka Moggallāna (M.iii.7; Thag.ver.1024) and Subha Todeyyaputta (D.i.204ff).<br>The Pāli Canon makes no mention of Ānanda’s death. Fa Hsien (Giles trans. 44. The story also occurs in DhA.ii.99ff., with several variations in detail), however, relates what was probably an old tradition. When Ānanda was on his way from Magadha to Vesāli, there to die, Ajātasattu heard that he was coming, and, with his retinue, followed him up to the Rohini River. The chiefs of Vesali also heard the news and went out to meet him, and both parties reached the river banks. Ānanda, not wishing to incur the displeasure of either party, entered into the state of tejokasina in the middle of the river and his body went up in flames. His remains were divided into two portions, one for each party, and they built cetiyas for their enshrinement (See also Rockhill, op. cit., 165f).<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Ānanda had been the son of Ānanda, King of Hamsavatī, and was therefore a step-brother of Padumuttara. His name was Sumana. King Ānanda allowed no one but himself to wait on the Buddha. Prince Sumana having quelled an insurrection of the frontier provinces, the king offered him a boon as reward, and he asked to be allowed to entertain the Buddha and his monks for three months. With great reluctance the king agreed, provided the Buddha’s consent was obtained. When Sumana went to the vihāra to obtain this, he was greatly impressed by the loyalty and devotion of the Buddha’s personal attendant, the monk Sumana, and by his iddhi-powers. Having learnt from the Buddha that these were the result of good deeds, he himself determined to lead a pious life. For the Buddha’s residence Prince Sumana bought a pleasaunce named Sobhana from a householder of that same name and built therein a monastery costing one hundred thousand. On the way from the capital to Sobhana Park he built vihāras, at distances of a league from each other. When all preparations were completed, the Buddha went to Sobhana with one hundred thousand monks, stopping at each vihāra on the way. At the festival of dedication of the Sobhana Vihāra, Sumana expressed a wish to become a personal attendant of a future Buddha, just as Sumana was of Padumuttara. Towards this end he did many good deeds. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave his upper garment to a monk for him to carry his begging-bowl in it. Later he was born in heaven and again as King of Benares. He built for eight Pacceka Buddhas eight monasteries in his royal park (ThagA.ii.121ff) and for ten thousand years he looked after them. The Apadāna mentions (i.52f) that he became ruler of heaven thirty-four times and king of men fifty-eight times.<br>Ānanda’s name occurs in innumerable Jātakas; he is identified with<br>Suriyakumāra in the Devadhamma Jātaka (i.133), Cullalohita in the Munika (i.198), Pajjuna in the Maccha (i.332), Kālakanni in the Kālakanni (i.365), Rādha in the Rādha (i.496), Potthapāda in the Rādha II.

As a result, he suffered in hell for a long time and was born for fourteen existences as some one’s wife, and it was seven existences more before the results of his evil deed were exhausted.<br>There seems to be some confusion as to the time at which Ānanda entered the Order. In the Canonical account (E.g., Vin.ii.182) he became a monk in the second year of the Buddha’s ministry. In the verses attributed to him in the Theragātha (Vers.1039ff), however, he says that he has been for twenty five years a learner (sekha). It is concluded from this that Ānanda must have joined the Order only in the twentieth year after the Enlightenment and the whole story of his having been ordained at the same time as Devadatta is discredited. (See, e.g., Thomas: op. cit., 123. See also Rhys Davids’ article on Devadatta in ERE). The verses occur in a lament by Ānanda that his master is dead and that he is yet a learner. The twenty-five years which Ānanda mentions probably refer to the period during which he had been the Buddha’s personal attendant and not to his whole career as a monk. During that period, ”though he was but a learner, no thoughts of evil arose in him,” the implication being that his close connection with the Buddha and his devotion to him gave no room for such. He, nevertheless, laments that he could not become an asekha while the Buddha was yet alive. If this interpretation be accepted - and I see no reason why it should not be - there is no discrepancy in the accounts of Ānanda’s ordination.<br>2. Ānanda.-A Khattiya king of Hamsavati, father of Padumuttara Buddha (J.i.37; Bu.xii.19). He had, by another wife, a daughter Nandā, who became the therī Pakulā in the present age (ThigA.91). Once, with twenty of his ministers and twenty thousand of his subjects, he appeared before Padumuttara Buddha at Mithilā and, having received the ”ehi-bhikkhu-pabbajjā,” they became arahants (MA.ii.722; DA.ii.488). The Buddha went back with them to Hamsavatī where he preached the Buddhavamsa (BuA.160).<br>One of Ānanda’s sons was the prince Sumana, step-brother to Padumuttara, who became Ānanda, the personal attendant of Gotama Buddha. ThagA.ii.122.<br>3. Ānanda.-Step-brother of Maṅgala Buddha. He came to Maṅgala Buddha with ninety crores of followers; having heard the Buddha’s preaching, they all became arahants. J.i.30.<br>4. Ānanda.-Son of Tissa Buddha, his mother being Subhaddā. Bu.xviii.18.<br>5. Ānanda.-Son of Phussa Buddha, his mother being Kisāgotami (Bu.xix.16). The Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.192), however, gives his name as Anupama.<br>6. Ānanda.-A Pacceka Buddha of ninety-one kappas ago. The thera Citakapūjaka, in a previous birth, came down from the deva-loka and cremated the Pacceka Buddha’s body with due honour (Ap.i.227). According to the Majjhima Nikāya and its Commentary (M.iii.70; MA.ii.890), there were four Pacceka Buddhas of this name.<br>7. Ānanda.-A king of vultures. He dwelt with ten thousand vultures in Gijjhakūta and came to hear Kunāla preach. At the end of Kunāla’s sermon Ānanda, too, discoursed in the same strain, dwelling on the evil qualities of women ”keeping to facts within his knowledge” (J.v.424, 447-50). He lived in the Kunāladaha with Nārada, Devala, Punnamukha, the cuckoo, and Kunāla (SnA.i.359). In the present age the vulture-king was Ānanda Thera, the Buddha’s attendant (J.v.456).<br>8. Ānanda.-A king of fishes, appointed by the fishes themselves to rule over them (J.i.207; ii.352). He was one of the six monsters of the deep. He lived on one side of the ocean and all the fishes came to him morning and evening to pay their respects. He lived on rock-slime (sevāla) till one day he swallowed, by mistake, a fish. Liking the taste very much, be found out what it was, and from that day he ate fish, unknown to his subjects. Seeing their numbers diminish, they began to grow inquisitive, and one day one of their wise ones hid in the lobe of Ānanda’s ear and discovered him eating the fish which straggled behind. When this was reported to the other fish, they fled in terror and hid themselves. Ānanda, desirous of eating them, searched everywhere; believing that they lay inside a mountain, he encircled it with his body. Seeing his own tail on the other side of the mountain and believing it to be a fish trying to escape, he crunched it in a rage. The tail was fifty leagues long and he suffered excruciating pain. Attracted by the smell of blood, the fish collected round and ate him bit by bit. His skeleton was as big as a mountain, and holy ascetics, flying through the air and seeing it below them, told men about it and the story became famous throughout Jambudīpa. Kālahatthi is reported as relating this story to the king in the Mahā Sutasoma Jātaka (J.v.462-4). Ānanda is referred to as an example of great deceitfulness. MA.i.138.<br>9. Ānanda. A yakkha to whom a shrine, called the Ānanda Cetiya, was dedicated. The Cetiya was in Bhoganagara and was later converted into a Buddhist Vihāra (AA.ii.550). There the Buddha stayed during his last sojourn, and mention is made of a sermon he preached there to the monks on the Four Great Authorities (cattāro mahāpadesā) (D.ii.123-6; A.ii.167). From there he went to Pāvā.<br>10. Ānanda.-A banker of Sāvatthi. He had eighty crores of money, but was a great miser. He had a son, Mūlasiri, and once a fortnight he would gather his kinsfolk together and, in their presence, admonish his son as to the desirability of amassing wealth, always increasing it, giving none away. When the banker died he was born in a Candāla family outside the city gates. The king appointed Mūlasiri banker in his place.<br>From the time of Ānanda’s conception among the Candālas, misfortune dogged their footsteps. Knowing that a Jonah had come among them, they caused a search to be made and, as a result of their investigations, they sent the pregnant mother away. When the child was born he was a monstrosity with his organs all out of place. When old enough, he was given a potsherd and told to beg his living. One day he came to the house in which he had lived in his former life, and though he managed to enter it, he was discovered and thrown out by the servants. The Buddha happened to be passing by, and sending for Mūlasiri, he told him that the beggar had been his father. Being convinced by certain proofs, Mūlasiri believed and took refuge in the Buddha (DhA.ii.25-8; the story is referred to in the Milindapañha p.350). It is said that eighty-four thousand beings attained deathlessness on the occasion of the Buddha preaching to Mūlasiri about his father Ānanda. AA.i.57.<br>11. Ānanda.-Author of the Mūlatikā on Buddhaghosa’s Commentaries on the Abhidhamma (Gv.60, 69; Sas.69). He was originally a native of India, but came over to Ceylon and became head of the Vanavāsi fraternity in the Island. He probably lived about the eighth or ninth century A.D. and wrote the Mūlatikā at the request of a monk named Buddhamitta. He is probably identical with Ānanda, teacher of Culla Dhammapāla (see below) (P.L.C.202f.; 216f). He was also known as Vanaratana Tissa from his connection with the Vanavāsi school.<br>12. Ānanda.-Teacher of Culla Dhammapāla, author of the Saccasankhepa. The Saddhamma Sanghala (ix) says that Ānanda was the author of the Saccasankhepa. See also above (Ānanda 11).<br>13. Ānanda.-Teacher of Buddhappiya, author of the Rūpasiddhi. He was a native of Ceylon, for Buddhapiya refers to him as ”Tambapannid-dhaja.” He too belonged to the Vanavāsi sect and wrote a Sinhalese interverbal translation to Piyadassi’s Pada-Sādhana and another to the Khudda-Sikkhā. He was a disciple of Udumbaragiri Medhankara, pupil of Sāriputta, and he probably lived in the time of Vijayabāhu III. (P.L.C. 211).<br>He was the teacher of Vedeha, author of the Samantakūavannanā (P.L.C. 220). See also Buddhavamsa Vanaratana Ānanda.<br>14. Ānanda.-Author of the Saddhammopāyana, also called Abhayagiri-Kavicakravarti Ānanda and probably belonging to the same period as Ānanda (13). His friend and companion, for whom his book was written, was Buddhasoma. An Ānanda, probably a later writer, is also the author of a Sinhalese Commentary on the Saddhammopāyana. P.L.C.212.<br>15. Ānanda.-Companion of Chapata and co-founder of the Sīhala-Sangha of Burma (Sās.65). He was later cut off from the community for trying to send to his kinsfolk an elephant presented to him by King Narapati. His companions suggested that the animal should be let loose in the forest, in accordance with the Buddha’s teaching regarding kindness to animals. Ānanda’s reply was that the Buddha had also preached kindness to kinsfolk (Bode: op. cit., 24). He died in 1246 (Forehammer: Jardine Prize Essay, p.35).<br>16. Ānanda.-Of Hamsavatī. Author of the Madhusāratthadīpanī, a tīkā on the Abhidhamma. Sās.48; but see Bode: op. cit., 47-8.<br>17. Ānanda.-Called Mānava, in order to distinguish him from others. He was a brahmin youth, maternal cousin of the therīUppalavannā, with whom he had been in love when she was a laywoman. One day when Upalavannā returned from her alms-rounds to her hut in Andhavana, where she was living at the time, ānandamānava, who was hiding under her bed, jumped up and seized her. In spite of her protestations and admonitions, he overcame her resistance by force and, having worked his will of her, went away. As if unable to endure his wickedness, the earth burst asunder and he was swallowed up in Avīci (DhA.ii.49-50).<br>In order that such assaults should not be repeated,Pasenadi Kosala erected, at the Buddha’s suggestion, a residence for the nuns within the city gates, and henceforth they lived only within the precincts of the city (DhA.ii.51f).'],
'ānandabodhi':['The bodhi-tree planted by ānanda at the entrance to Jetavana.<br>The people of Sāvatthi, led by Anāthapindika, suggested to ānanda that some place should be provided where they might offer flowers and perfumes in the name of the Buddha, when the Buddha was away on his periodical tours.<br>After consultation with the Buddha, ānanda obtained, with Moggallāna’s assistance, a fruit from the bodhi-tree at Gayā, and had it planted at the gateway of Jetavana in the presence of a large and distinguished gathering, including Pasenadi Kosala andVisākhā.<br>The seed was planted by Anāthapindika in a golden jar filled with fragrant earth. Immediately a sapling sprang up, fifty cubits tall, with five branches, each fifty cubits long.<br>The king poured round the tree perfumed water from eight hundred jars of gold and silver.<br>In order to consecrate the new tree, the Buddha, at ānanda’s request, sat under it for one night, in the rapture of samāpatti.<br>Because the tree was planted by ānanda, it became known as ānandabodhi (J.iv.228-30).<br>Pilgrims who came to the Buddha at Jetavana were in the habit of paying respect to the ānandabodhi (J.ii.321).<br>The Paduma Jātaka and theKālingabodhi Jātaka were both preached in reference to this bodhi-tree.'],

'ānandā':['One of the five daughters of the chief queen of the king of the third Okkāka dynasty (DA.i.258: SnA.i.352).<br>The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.84) says that Okkāka was the youngest of the sixteen kings of the Mahāsammata dynasty and makes no mention of three Okkāka dynasties.<br>The name of Okkāka’s chief queen was Hatthā (v.l.

(MA.ii.895-6.)<br>Seeing them thus assembled, the Buddha was pleased with their demeanour and described how in the confraternity of monks were to be found men of various degrees of attainment. Some of them practised the cultivation of mindfulness by breathing exercises and the Buddha proceeded to explain how it was done.

Mahāabhaya bathed him in warm water and rubbed oil on his body, saying it was not his business to take revenge. Harantika later became a monk and attained arahantship. Ras.ii.5f.'],

Once when Mahā Kaccana was staying at Varanā on the banks of the Kaddamadaha, ārāmadanda came to see him and asked him why nobles quarrelled with nobles, brahmins with brahmins, and householders with householders. ”Because of their bondage and servitude to sensual lusts,” answered Mahā Kaccāna; and for the same reason recluses quarrelled with recluses. ”Is there anybody in the world who has passed beyond this bondage?” ”Yes,” said Mahā Kaccāna, ”in Sāvatthi lives the Exalted One,” and he proceeded to describe the Buddha’s virtues. āramadanda stood up with clasped hands and, turning in the direction of Sāvatthi, he uttered his adoration of the Buddha.

The monkey-king agreed and, when the man had gone, distributed the water-skins and water-pots among the monkeys. In order that the water should not be wasted, he gave instructions to the monkeys that they should pull out the trees by the roots and give plenty of water to those plans whose roots went deep and little to those with small roots. A wise man, happening to see this being done, and reflecting how with every desire to do good, the foolish only succeed in doing harm, rebuked the monkey-king.<br>The story was told by the Buddha while staying in a hamlet inKosala. The squire of the village invited the Buddha and his monks to a meal and at the conclusion of the meal gave them leave to stroll about in the grounds. In their walk the monks came across a bare patch of land and learnt from the gardener that it was caused by a lad who had been asked to water the plants there and who, before watering them had pulled them out to see how they grew. This was reported to the Buddha, who related the story of the past. J.i.249-51.

At the end of the third year the king, disgusted by his failure, started to go home, but again the girl engaged him in conversation, and in the course of their talk the girl’s name was mentioned. When the king was told that the word had occurred in his talk, he returned to the Bodhisatta and told it to him.

'bahudhīti':['A brahmin of the Bhāradvājagotta who had seven widowed daughters and was much in debt.<br>One day he lost fourteen oxen, and, after searching for them for six days, he came across the Buddha in a forest tract. He spoke the praises of the Buddha’s freedom, unperturbed by the anxieties to which he himself was a prey for the Buddha had no nagging wife, no creditors, no vermin disturbing his sleep. The Buddha agreed with him, and he was so pleased with the Buddha’s words that he asked to be ordained. The Buddha ordained him (S.i.170f ); the Commentary adds (SA.i.187ff), that he took the newly ordained to Pasenadi to whom he related what had happened. The king summoned the man’s creditors; and paid them off, and having sent for his wife and daughters he took them under his protection. The man soon after became an arahant.'],

In addition to the five propositions held by theMahāsanghikas, they considered it as a fundamental doctrine that<br>there is no mode of life leading to real salvation, that the truth of suffering is the Noble Truth, that to perceive the suffering of the samskāras is to enter perfect purity, that there is no way of seeing the misery of suffering and the misery of change; the Sangha is but subject to worldly laws and conditions, arahants acquire the doctrine of others, there is a rightly preached way and a right entry into samāpatti.

'bahuputta':['A shrine in the neighbourhood of Vesāli, to the north of that city (D.iii.9). The Buddha is said to have stayed there (D.ii.118;, Ud.vi.1; S.v.259). It was a pre Buddhist shrine and, according to the Commentaries (E.g., UdA.323; SA.ii.128, etc.), was a many branched nigrodha tree where persons prayed for sons to the deva of the tree. Hence its name.<br>Mahā Kassapa says that while yet a ”learner” he paid homage to the Buddha at a Bahuputtaka-nigrodha where the Buddha had gone to meet him. The Buddha taught him of the training to be followed and, profiting by the lesson, eight days later Mahā Kassapa became an arahant. This nigrodha, however, was on the road from Rājagaha to Nālandā and was three leagues from Rājagaha*. It cannot, therefore, have been identical with the tree, which gave its name to the Bahuputta cetiya.<br>* S.ii.220; see Mahā Kassapa.

Udāyi answers that there are three:<br>pleasant, unpleasant and indifferent. Pañcakaṅga, however, insists that there are but two: pleasant and unpleasant. Ananda, overhearing the conversation, reports it to the Buddha, who says that both Pañcakaṅga and Udāyi are correct because he himself classified feelings in various ways; sensual pleasures might be pleasant, but are not the highest pleasures; far better and more excellent are the pleasures enjoyed by a monk who develops the four jhānas, the plane of infinity of consciousness and the plane of nought.<br>M.i.396ff.; the Sutta is repeated at S.iv.223ff., under the name ofPañcakaṅga Sutta.'],

The Buddha, aware of this, went to the Brahma world and stood in the air enveloped in flame.<br>He was followed by Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina and Anuruddha. Moggallāna asked the Brahmā if he still held the same view, to which he replied that he no longer thought that he was eternal. (This shows that the Brahmā of the story was most probably Baka.)<br>When the Buddha and his followers had departed, the Brahmā sent one of his retinue to Moggallāna to find out if there were other disciples of the Buddha as mighty as he. Moggallāna’s answer was that there were many such (the sutta is given at S.i.144 ff., but there the name given is “Aparāditthi” Sutta).'],

'bakkula':['He was; born in the family of a councillor of Kosambī, and, while being bathed by his nurse in the waters of the Yamunā, he slipped into the river and was swallowed by a fish. The fish was caught by an angler and sold to the wife of a Benares councillor.* When the fish was split open the child was discovered unhurt, and cherished by the councillor’s wife as her own son. On discovering his story, she asked permission of his parents to keep him. The king decided that the two families should have him in common, hence his name Bākula (two families - bi kin).**<br>* This preservation of Bakkula was due to the power of the sanctity of his last life; it was a case of psychic power diffused by knowledge (ñānavipphārā iddhi), PS.ii.211; Vsm.379.<br>** Cp. the explanation of bakkula in J.P.T.S. 1886, pp. 95ff.<br>After a prosperous life, at the age of eighty, Bakkula heard the Buddha preach and left the world. For seven days he remained unenlightened, but on the dawn of the eighth day he became an arahant. Later, the Buddha declared him to be foremost in good health (A.i.25; for a problem connected with this, see Mil.215ff.).<br>In the time of Anomadassī Buddha, he was a learned Brahmin who became a holy hermit. He heard the Buddha preach and became his follower, and when the Buddha suffered from stomach trouble, he cured him and was reborn later in the Brahma world. In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, he was a householder of Hamsavatī, and, hearing a monk acclaimed as most healthy, he wished for a similar honour in a future life. Before the appearance of Vipassī Buddha, he was born in Bandhumatī, where he became a hermit. Later, he saw the Buddha, acknowledged him as teacher, and cured a monk of tiṇapupphakaroga (? hay fever).<br>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, he renovated an old vihāra and provided the monks with medicaments (AA.i.168 ff.; MA.ii.928 ff.; ThagA.i.434 ff.; Ap.i.328 ff.; PSA.491). Bakkula lived to a very old age* (AA.ii.596), and shortly before his death ordained Acela Kassapa, who had been his friend in his lay days.** Bakkula was one of the four who had great abhiññā (mahābhiññappattā) in the time of Gotama Buddha, the others being the two chief disciples and Bhaddā Kaccānā (AA.i.204). He is often mentioned (E.g., MA.i.348) as an example of a monk who practised asceticism without preaching it to others. Fifty five kappas ago he was a king named Anoma (v.l. Aranemī) (Ap.i.329).<br>* according to the Bakkula Sutta (M.iii.125), he was eighty years a monk. This is confirmed by DA.ii.413, where his age is given as 160.<br>** See Bakkula Sutta below.

When the inhabitants of the village came to Upāli with their taxes, he went with them (bālakagāmavāsiniyā . . . parisāya) to see Nigantha Nātaputta.<br>The other explanation is that the word bālakiniyā in the text is an adjective meaning ”composed of fools” (bālavatiyā bālussannāya) (Cp.,J.i.246, where mention is made of bālagāmikamanussā who were obviously fools). The confusion seems, therefore, to have arisen very early. Upāli’s village (of Bāka), if such a place existed, was probably near Nālandā.'],

Bāvarī was greatly distressed, but a devatā (his mother in a previous birth, AA.i.183), seeing his trouble, reassured him by saying that the brahmin knew neither the meaning of ”head” nor of ”the splitting of it.” ”Who then knows it?” asked Bāvarī, and the devatā told him of the appearance in the world of the Buddha. Forthwith he sent his sixteen pupils -<br>Ajita, Tissametteyya, Punnaka, Mettagū, Dhotaka, Upasīva, Nanda, Hemaka, Todeyya, Kappa, Jatukannī, Bhadrāvudha, Udaya, Posāla, Mogharāja and Pingiya to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha and to find out if his claims to Buddha-hood were justified.

For a problem arising out of the manner in which some of the marks were seen, see Mil.168f.; DA.i.275f. This account is given in SN.vs.976 1148.<br>According to the Commentary (SNA.603f), all Bāvarī’s disciples and their sixteen thousand followers whom they had gathered on their way, became arahants at the conclusion of the Buddha’s sermon, save only Pingiya, Bāvarī’s nephew, who became an anāgāmī, because he had been thinking of Bāvarī when the Buddha preached. Pingiya took leave of the Buddha and returned to Bāvarī, to whom he recounted all these events. At the end of his recital, the Buddha appeared before them in a ray of glory and preached to them. Pingiya thereupon became an arahant and Bāvarī an anāgāmī.<br>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Bāvarī was KingKatthavāhana.

Unwilling to remain longer in the court, he took leave of the king and lived in the royal park as an ascetic. Then, wishing for greater peace, he retired to an island (antaradīpa) in theGodhāvarī where the two kingsAssaka and Alaka gave him a tract of land, five leagues in extent, the residence of the sages of old.

When he needed food, after samāpatti he would sprinkle water on the rice and eat it instead of going for alms. When this was reported to the Buddha, he blamed Belatthasīsa for storing up food and promulgated a rule forbidding this (Vin.iv.86).<br>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.171), however, states that the offence was committed after the rule was laid down, and, because the food was stored, not because of greed but through lack of covetousness, the Buddha declared Balatthasīsa free from guilt.<br>Belatthasīsa was a brahmin of Sāvatthi who had left the world under Uruvela Kassapa before the Buddha’s Enlightenment and was converted when Uruvela Kassapa became a follower of the Buddha.<br>He had been a monk in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, but could achieve no attainment.

He fell grievously ill during this period, but, by a great effort of will, overcame his sickness. During this sickness Sākka ministered to the Buddha, waiting on him and carrying on his head the Buddha’s stools when he suffered from acute dysentery (DhA.iii.269 f.).<br>It was at this time that the Buddha, in answer to a question by Ananda, said that he had kept nothing back from his disciples and had no special instructions for the Order to follow after his death. Each disciple must work out his own salvation. D.ii.98 ff.; S.v.151ff.<br>Ananda is also mentioned as having stayed at Beluva after the Buddha’s death. The householder Dasama of Atthakanagara sought him there, amid their conversation is recorded in the Atthakanagara Sutta (M.i.349ff.; A.v.342ff).<br>Beluva was a small village, and when the Buddha was there the monks stayed in Vesāli. Beluva was just outside the gates of Vesāli (SA.iii.165) and was to the south of this city (MA.ii.571).<br>The Theragāthā (vs.919) states that Anuruddha died at Veluvagāma in the Vajjī country. This probably refers to Beluvagāma, in which case Veluva is a varia lectio.'],
'beluvapaṇḍuvīnā':['The lute carried by Pañcasikha; it belonged originally to Māra.<br>When Māra, after wasting seven years trying in vain to discover some shortcoming in the Buddha - six years before the Enlightenment and one year after it - left theBuddha in disgust and weariness, the lute which he carried slung on his shoulder slipped and fell. Sakka picked it up and gave it to Paññcasikha. It was so powerful that when plucked with the fingers the lovely music produced echoed on for four months (SNA.ii.393f).<br>The vīnā was three gāvutas in length (BuA.239) and had fifty trestles (AA.i.72). The Sumaṅgala Vilāsinī (DA.iii.699) describes it at length. It was pale yellow, like a ripe beluva fruit. Its base (pokkhara) was of gold, its stem of sapphire its strings of silver, and its knots (vethikā) of coral.<br>The vīnā was probably so called partly because its base was made of a bilva-fruit, instead of the usual gourd, and partly because of its color.'],
'benares':['See Bārānasī.'],
'bhaddaji sutta':['A discussion between Bhaddaji andAnanda at the Ghositārāma.<br>In answer to Ananda’s questions, Bhaddaji says that Brahmā is the best of sights; the best of sounds is that of Radiant Devas shouting ”Joy, joy,” etc. Ananda says that such is the talk of puthujjanas. The best sight, in his view, is that of the destruction of the āsavas; the best sound that of their destruction, etc.<br>A.iii.202f.'],
'bhaddaji thera':['The son of a setthi in Bhaddiya. He was worth eighty crores, and was brought up in luxury like that of the Bodhisatta in his last birth. When Bhaddaji was grown up, the Buddha came to Bhaddiya to seek him out, and stayed at the Jātiyāvana with a large number of monks. Thither Bhaddaji went to hear him preach. He became an arahant, and, with his father’s consent, was ordained by the Buddha. Seven weeks later he accompanied the Buddha to Kotigāma, and, while the Buddha was returning thanks to a pious donor on the way, Bhaddaji retired to the bank of the Ganges outside the village, where he stood wrapt in jhāna, emerging only when the Buddha came by, not having heeded the preceding chief theras. He was blamed for this; but, in order to demonstrate the attainments of Bhaddaji, the Buddha invited him to his own ferry boat and bade him work a wonder. Bhaddaji thereupon raised from the river bed, fifteen leagues into the air, a golden palace twenty leagues high, in which he had lived as Mahāpanāda. On this occasion theMahāpanāda or Suruci Jātaka was preached.<br>The Mahāvamsa account (xxxi.37ff) says that, before raising Mahāpaṇada’s palace, Bhaddaji rose into the air to the height of seven palmyra trees, holding the Dussa Thūpa from the Brahma world in his hand. He then dived into the Ganges and returned with the palace. The brahminNanduttara, whose hospitality the Buddha and his monks had accepted, saw this miracle of Bhaddaji, and himself wished for similar power by which he might procure relics in the possession of others. He was reborn as the novice Sonuttara, who obtained the relics for the thūpas of Ceylon.<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Bhaddaji was a brahmin ascetic who, seeing the Buddha travelling through the air, offered him honey, lotus stalks, etc. Soon after he was struck by lightning and reborn in Tusita. In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a very rich setthi and fed sixty eight thousand monks, to each of whom he gave three robes. Later, he ministered to five hundred Pacceka Buddhas. In a subsequent birth his son was a Pacceka Buddha, and he looked after him and built a cetiya over his remains after his death.

'bhaddakaccānā':['The youngest of the children of Pandu, the Sākiyan. She was so beautiful that seven kings begged to be allowed to marry her. Her father, unable to decide between her suitors, put her in a boat with thirty two companions and launched the boat upon the Ganges. The boat arrived in the course of the following day at Gonagāmaka in Ceylon, where the women landed, dressed as nuns. In due course they came to Upatissagāma, where the king, Panduvāsudeva, warned by soothsayers, awaited their arrival and married Bhaddakaccānā.<br>Later, six of her brothers came to Ceylon and settled in different parts; the brothers were Rāma, Uruvela, Anurādha, Vijita, Dīghāyu and Rohana. The seventh brother, Gāmani, stayed at home.<br>Bhaddakaccānā had ten children, the eldest being Abhaya and the youngest Ummādacittā. Mhv.viii.18ff.; ix. 1, 9 f.; Dpv.x.1ff.'],
'bhaddasāla jātaka':['Brahmadatta, king of Benares, wishing to have a palace built on one column, sent his carpenters to find a suitable tree. They found many such in the forest, but no road by which to transport them. At last they discovered a lordly sāla tree in the king’s park and made preparations to cut it down. The deity of the tree (Bhaddasāla 2), who was the Bodhisatta, was greatly distressed at the prospect of the destruction of his children. He, therefore, visited the king by night and begged him not to have the tree cut down. When the king refused this request, Bhaddasāla asked that the tree should be cut down in pieces, so that in its fall it might not damage its kindred round about. This feeling of Bhaddasāla for his kinsmen touched the king, and he desisted from his purpose of destroying the tree.<br>The story was related in reference to the Buddha’s interference withVidūdabha when he wished to destroy the Sākyans.<br>Ananda is identified with the king (J.iv.153-7).<br>On this occasion was preached also the Kukkura Jātaka (No.22), the Kāka Jātaka (No.140), and the Mahākapi Jātaka (No.407).'],

One of them had no wife, and for him they found a courtesan; but she awaited the opportunity and ran away with their goods.<br>While seeking for her, they saw the Buddha and enquired if he had seen a woman. But he answered, should they not rather seek the ”self” than a woman. They all agreed thereto, and he preached to them. At the end of the sermon they realized the Truth and were ordained (Vin.i.23f.; DhA.ii.33f).<br>Their conversion was one of the subjects sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa.

'bhaddayānikā':['An offshoot of the Vajjiputtaka heretics (Mhv.v.7; Dpv.v.46).<br>Their doctrines resembled those of the Dhammuttariyas; in birth is ignorance and in the arresting of birth is the arresting of ignorance (Rockhill, op. cit., 194).<br>They also held the view that the corruptions were put away by slices. Mrs. Rhys Davids, Points of Controversy, p. 130.'],
'bhaddā':['A Therī. She was foremost among nuns, of swift intuition, and was born in the family of a treasurer of Rājagaha. On the same day, a son was born to the king’s chaplain under a constellation favourable to highwaymen, and was therefore called Sattuka. One day, through her lattice, Bhaddā saw Sattuka being led by the city guard to execution on a charge of robbery. She fell at once in love with him and refused to live without him. Her father, out of his love for her, bribed the guard to release Sattuka, let him be bathed in perfumed water, and brought him home, where Bhaddā, decked in jewels, waited upon him. Very soon, Sattuka began to covet her jewels and told her that he had made a vow to the deity of the Robbers’ Cliff that, should he escape, he would bring him an offering. She trusted him and, making ready an offering, went with him arrayed in all her ornaments. On arriving at the top of the cliff, he told her of his purpose, and she, all undaunted, begged of him to let her embrace him on all sides. He agreed to this, and then, making as if to embrace him from the back, she pushed him over the cliff. The deity of the mountain praised her presence of mind saying that men were not in all cases wiser than women.<br>Unwilling to return home after what had happened; she joined the Order of the white robed Niganthas. As she wished to practise extreme austerities, they dragged out her hair with a palmyra comb. Her hair grew again in close curls, and so they called her Kundala-kesā (”Curly-hair”). Dissatisfied with the teaching of the Niganthas, she left them, and going to various teachers, became very, proficient in discussion and eager for debate. She would enter a village and, making a heap of sand at the gate, set up the branch of a rose apple saying, ”Whoever wishes to enter into discussion with me, let him trample on this bough.” One day, Sāriputta, seeing the bough outside Sāvatthi, ordered some children to trample on it. Bhaddā then went to Jetavana accompanied by a large crowd whom she had invited to be present at the discussion. Sāriputta suggested that Bhaddā should first ask him questions; to all of these he replied until she fell silent. It was then his turn, and he asked ”One what is that?” (probably meaning: ”state any one fact true for everyone”) She, unable to answer, asked him to be her teacher. But Sāriputta sent her to the Buddha, who preached to her that it were better to know one single stanza bringing calm and peace than one thousand verses bringing no profit. At the end of this sermon, Bhaddā attained arahantship, and the Buddha himself ordained her.<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, she had heard him preach and place as foremost among nuns one whose intuition was swift (khippābhiññā). She vowed that this rank should one day be hers. Later, when Kassapa was Buddha, she was one of the seven daughters of Kikī, king of Benares, and was named Bhikkhadāyikā (v.l. Bhikkhudāsikā). For twenty thousand years she remained celibate and built a dwelling for the Order. A.i.25; AA.i.200ff.; ThigA.99ff.; Ap.ii.560ff. The DhA. Account (ii. 217 ff.) differs in various details. There Bhaddā is shut up by her parents at the top of a seven storied building with only a single woman to wait on her, for ”girls when young, burn for men!” It was thus that she saw the robber.<br>In the Therīgāthā (Thig.vss.107-11) are included several verses spoken by her when she had been a nun for fifty years, wandering about in Anga, Magadha, Kāsi and Kosala, living on the people’s alms.'],
'bhaddāli sutta':['Preached to Bhaddāli (q.v.) when he confessed his fault. The monk, who believes in the Buddha and obeys his instructions, will ultimately understand dukkka and will bring it to an end.<br>The sutta also contains the parable of the Ajāniya horse. A horse, schooled by an expert trainer and put through the various stages of training, becomes endowed with ten qualities, and is fit to be regarded as a treasure by a king. Similarly, a man who has developed the Noble Eightfold Path and obtained right knowledge and right deliverance, becomes the richest field in which the seed of merit may be sown. M.i.437ff.'],
'bhaddāli thera':['When the Buddha, at Jetavana, laid down the rule that monks should eat one meal a day and that in the morning, Bhaddāli protested and refused to keep this rule because he said that, in so eating, he would be a prey to scruples and misgivings. For three months he avoided the Buddha, until, just before the Buddha was starting on a journey, Bhaddāli, acting on the advice of his fellow monks, confessed his fault to the Buddha and begged for forgiveness (M.i.437ff). The Buddha praised this action and preached to him the Bhaddāli Sutta (q.v.).<br>It is said (MA.ii.648) that, in a previous birth, Bhaddāli had been a crow, therefore in this life he was always hungry and was known among his fellows as the Great Eater (Mahāchātaka).<br>Thirty kappas ago he met Sumedha Buddha in the forest, wrapt in meditation, and, having tidied the place where the Buddha was sitting, he erected over him a pavilion. Ap.ii.365f.'],
'bhaddekaratta sutta':['Preached at Jetavana. The true saint is he who does not hanker after the past and does not long for the future. He is not swept away by present states of consciousness, but scanning his heart with insight, he struggles unceasingly to win eternal Changelessness (M.iii.187 ff).<br>This sutta was learned by Ananda and used by him in an exposition to his colleagues. This exposition was approved by the Buddha and came to be called the Ananda-Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.189 ff). One day, asSamiddhi was drying himself after bathing at Tapodā in Rājagaha, a deity questioned him on this sutta, and he had to confess his ignorance. Samiddhi then went to the Buddha and asked him about the sutta, and the Buddha preached to him only the verses, with no explanation. The monks, who were present, thereupon asked Mahā Kaccāna for a detailed exposition. He gave it, and the monks referred it to the Buddha who advised them to remember it. This exposition came to be called the Mahā Kaccāna Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.192 ff).<br>Similarly, Lomasakangiya was asked about the sutta by the god Candana, when he was staying in the Nigrodhārāma at Kapilavatthu. He, in his turn, had to confess his ignorance, and Candana taught him the verses, which, he said, were uttered by the Buddha during his visit to Tāvatimsa. When he went to preach the Abhidhamma. The Commentary (MA.ii.962) explains that the Buddha preached this sutta for the benefit of devas who could not understand the Abhidhamma. Lomasakangiya learnt the verses, and, going to the Buddha, questioned him concerning them. The Buddha made them clear to him. This account is called the Lomasakangiya-Bhaddekaratta Sutta (M.iii.199ff).<br>Extracts from the Bhaddekaratta Sutta are uttered by speakers in the Hatthipāla Jātaka (J.iv.481) and theMahākapi Jātaka (J.v.66).'],

'bhadra':['The headman Bhadragaka visits the Buddha at Uruvelakappa and asks for a teaching about dukkha. The Buddha says he will talk neither of the future nor of the past, but only of the present. By means of questioning Bhadragaka, the Buddha makes him realize that sorrow and suffering come only through desire. For example, he would grieve if anything happened to his friends in Uruvelakappa, or to his son Ciravāsi, or to his wife; but he would not worry about those who were unknown to him and therefore unloved by him (S.iv.327f).<br>The Commentary says (SA.iii.103) that in this sutta vattadukkha (? the sorrow of transmigration) is described.'],
'bhadraghata jātaka':['Once the Bodhisatta was a rich merchant with an only son. He did great good and was born as Sakka.

But one day, when the son was drunk, he threw the cup into the air and smashed it, thus reducing himself once again to misery.<br>The story was told in reference to a ne’er-do-well nephew ofAnāthapindika.

He was very pious, and once had the whole of the Mahā Thūpa covered with sandalwood paste in which were embedded sweet smelling flowers. On another occasion he covered the whole thūpa with flowers and sprinkled them with water drawn by machines from the Abhaya-vāpi. He made a plaster covering for the Mahā Thūpa into which were mixed many, cartloads of pearls.

Owing to her, her kinsmen, too, lived in happiness (VibhA.440).<br>Bhātikābhaya once heard a Sutta (see A.v.21f ) in which the Buddha had declared that, of all perfumes, that of jasmine was the strongest. In order to test this the king filled a room with the four kinds of perfume and then placed in it handfuls of various flowers, including jasmine. He then left the room and shut the door. After a while he entered again, and the first scent which greeted him was that of jasmine. Convinced of the truth of the Buddha’s statement, he fell prostrate and worshipped him (AA.ii.819).<br>It is said (SA.ii.180) that the king once asked a reciter to tell him of an auspicious stanza (jayamaṅgala) connected with all the Three Jewels.

Bhīmasena went with him to the king of Benares and obtained the post of royal archer. Once, the kingdom was attacked by a tiger and Bhīmasena was sent to kill it. Following the advice of the Bodhisatta, he went with a large band of country men, and when the tiger was sighted he waited in a thicket and lay flat on his face. When he knew that the tiger had been killed, he came out of the thicket trailing a creeper in his hand and blamed the people, saying that he had meant to lead the tiger like an ox to the king and had gone into the wood to find a creeper for that purpose. ”Who has killed the tiger and spoilt all my plans?” he asked. ”I will report all of you to the king.” The terrified people bribed him heavily and said no word as to who had killed the tiger. The king, believing that Bhīmasena himself had killed it, rewarded him handsomely. The same thing happened with a buffalo. Bhīmasena grew rich and began to neglect the Bodhisatta. Soon after, a hostile king marched on Benares. Bhīmasena went with a large army riding on an elephant, the Bodhisatta behind him, but at the sight of the battlefield Bhīmasena was so terrified that he fouled the elephant’s back.

Kosiya refused their request until each one uttered a little verse, when he was asked to enter and receive a small gift. Kosiya asked the servant to give each a little unhusked rice. This was refused, and in the end he was obliged to give the brahmins cooked rice, meant for cows. Each swallowed a mouthful, but then let it stick in his throat and lay down as if dead. Kosiya, very frightened, had a meal prepared, which he put into their bowls, and then, calling in the passers by, asked them to note how the brahmins, in their greed, had eaten too much and died.

For seven days the child lay in the womb of a goat, each day a fresh one, until, at the end of these seven days, the child was ready for birth.

The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.427) define the word thus: Bodhisatto ti paṇḍitasatto bujjhanakasatto; bodhisankhātesu vā catusu maggesu āsatto laggamānaso ti Bodhisatto. See also AA.i.453. For a discussion of the meaning of the word see Har Dayal: The Bodhisativa Doctrine, pp.4ff.<br>The word can therefore be used in reference to all those who seek Nibbāna, including Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, and the disciples of Buddhas (Buddha-paccekabuddha-buddha-sāvakā), but is commonly used only of those beings who seek to become Buddhas. The word may have been used originally only in connection with the last life of a Buddha, in such contexts as ”in the days before my Enlightenment, when as yet I was only a Bodhisatta”. E.g., M.i.17, 114, 163; so also in the Mahāpadāna Sutta (D.ii.13) and the Acchariyaabbhutadhamma Sutta (M.iii.119).<br>But already in the Kathāvatthu (e.g., 283 90, 623) the previous lives of Gotama Buddha and other saints had begun to excite interest and speculation.<br>In the developed form of the ideas regarding Bodhisattas, a Bodhisatta’s career started with his making a resolution before a Buddha (abhinīhārakarana or mūlapanidhāna) to become a Buddha for the welfare and liberation of all creatures. In later literature, the abhinīhāra is preceded by a period during which the Bodhisatta practises manopanidhi, when he resolves in his mind to desire to become a Buddha without declaring this intention to others.<br>For the abhinīhāra to be effective, eight conditions should be fulfilled (Bu.ii.59; explained at BuA.75f. and SNA.i.48f): the aspirant should be<br>(1) a human being, (2) a male, (3) sufficiently developed to become an arahant in that very birth, (4) a recluse at the time of the declaration, (5) he should declare his resolve before a Buddha, (6) should be possessed of attainments such as the jhānas, (7) be prepared to sacrifice all, even life, and (8) his resolution should be absolutely firm and unwavering. In the case of Gotama Buddha, his abhinīhāra was made at Amaravātī in the presence of Dīpankara Buddha. His name at that time was Sumedha (q.v.). The Buddha, before whom the abhinīhāra is made, looks into the future and, if satisfied, declares the fulfilment of the resolve, mentioning the particulars of such fulfilment. This declaration is called vyākarana, and is made also by all subsequent Buddhas whom the Bodhisatta may meet during his career. Having received his first vyākarana, the Bodhisatta proceeds to investigate the qualities which should be acquired by him for the purposes of Buddhahood (buddhakārakadhammā), in accordance with the custom of previous Bodhisattas. These he discovers to be ten in number, the Ten Perfection, (dasapārami):<br>dāna, sīla, nekkhamma, paññā, viriya, khanti, sacca, aditthāna, mettā and upekhā. Bu.ii.116ff. Sometimes thirty pāramī are spoken of, each of the ten being divided into three, varying in kind and degree. Thus, in the case of<br>dāna, the dānapārami consists in giving one’s limbs, dāna upapārami in giving away one’s external possessions and dānapāramatthapāramī in giving one’s life, this last being the most excellent. In the case of Gotama Buddha, examples of births in which the ten pārami were practised to the highest degree are as follows: the Ekarāja, Khantivādī, Cūlla-Sankhapāla, Mahājanaka, Mahāsutasoma, Mūgapakkha, Lomahamsa, Sattubhattaka, Sasa, and Sutasoma Jātakas (BuA. 50; J.i.44f).<br>He also develops the four Buddhabhūmi (catasso buddhabhūmiyo) -<br>ussāha, ummagga, avatthāna and hitacariyā - explained respectively as zealousness (viriya), wisdom (paññā), resolution (adhitthāna) and compassion (mettābhāvanā).<br>He cultivates the six ajjhāsayas which conduce to the maturing of Enlightenment (bodhiparipākiyā samvattanti), these six being:<br>nekkhammajjhāsaya, pavivekajjhāsaya, alobhajjhāsaya, adosajjhāsaya, amohajjhāsaya and nissaravajjhāsaya. SNA.i.50A Bodhisatta, during his career, escapes from being born in eighteen inauspicious states (atthārasa abhabbatthānāni). He is never born blind, deaf, insane, slobbery (elamūga) or crippled, or among savages (milakkkesu), in the womb of a slave, or as a heretic. He never changes his sex, is never guilty of any of the five ānantarikakammas, and never becomes a leper. If born as an animal, he never becomes less than a quail or more than an elephant. He is never born either among various classes of petas nor among the Kālakañjakas, neither in Avīci nor in the lokantāraka nirayas, neither as Māra, nor in worlds where there is no perception (asaññibhava), nor in the Suddhāvāsas, nor in the Arūpa worlds, nor ever in another Cakkavāla. SNA.i.50 f.<br>Besides practising the (thirty) pārami, all Bodhisattas must make the five great sacrifices (mahāpariccāgā) - giving up<br>wife, children, kingdom, life and limb (J.vi.552) and must fulfil the three kinds of conduct (cariyā)<br>ñātatthacariyā, lokatthacariyā and buddhiatthacariyā and the seven mahādanas as practised by Vessantara, which caused the earth to quake seven times. DA.ii.427; DhA.iii.441; the BuA. (116 f.) gives a story about Maṅgala Buddha which corresponds to that of Vessantara in regard to Gotama Buddha. See Kharadāṭhika.<br>The length of a Bodhisatta’s career varies; some practice the pāramī for at least four asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, others for at least eight asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, and yet others for sixteen asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas. The first of these periods is the very least that is required and is intended for those who excel in wisdom (paññā). The middle is for those who excel in faith (saddhā); and the last and highest for those whose chief feature is perseverance (viriya) (SNA.i.47 f).<br>In their penultimate life all Bodhisattas are born in Tusita (see Buddha), where life lasts for fifty seven crores and six million years, but most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing their life span. Vipassī, e.g., was among the exceptions (DA.ii.427).<br>As the time for the announcement of their last birth approaches, all is excitement because of various signs appearing in the ten thousand world systems. The devas of all the worlds assemble in Tusita and request the Bodhisatta to seek birth as a human being, that he may become the Buddha. The Bodhisatta withholds his reply until he has made the Five Great Investigations (pañcamahāvilokanā) regarding time, continent, place of birth, his mother and the life span left to her. Buddhas do not appear in the world when men live to more than one hundred thousand years or to less than one hundred. They are born only in Jambudīpa and in the Majjhimadesa, and only of a khattiya or brahmin clan. The Bodhisatta’s mother in his last birth must not be passionate or given to drink; she should have practised the pārami for one hundred thousand kappas, have kept the precepts inviolate from birth, and should not be destined to live more than ten months and seven days after the conception of the Bodhisatta.<br>Having satisfied himself as to these particulars, the Bodhisatta goes with the other devas to Nandanavana in Tusita, where he announces his departure from their midst and disappears from among them while playing. On the day of his conception, the Bodhisatta’s mother takes the vows of fasting and celibacy at the conclusion of a great festival, and when she has retired to rest, she dreams that the Four Regent Gods take her with her bed, bathe her in the Anotatta Lake, clad her in divine garments, and place her in a golden palace surrounded by all kinds of luxury. As she lies there the Bodhisatta in the form of a white elephant enters her womb through her right side. The earth trembles and all the ten thousand world systems are filled with radiance. Immediately the Four Regent Gods assume guard over mother and child. Throughout the period of pregnancy, which lasts for ten months; exactly, the mother remains free from ailment and sees the child in her womb sitting crossed legged (like a preacher on a dais, says the Commentary DA.ii.436). At the end of the ten months; she gives birth to the child, standing in a grove, never indoors. Suddhāvāsa brahmins, free from all passion, first receive the child in a golden net, and from them the Four Regent Gods take him on an antelope skin and present him to his mother. Though the Bodhisatta is born free of the mucous otherwise present at birth, two showers of water - one hot, the other cold - fall from the sky and bathe mother and child. The child then takes seven strides to the north, standing firmly on his feet, looks on all sides, and seeing no one anywhere to equal him, announces his supremacy over the whole world and the fact that this is his last birth. (Gotama Buddha as the Bodhisatta, spoke, in three different births, as soon as born - as Mahosadha, as Vessantara, and in his last birth, J.i.53).<br>Seven days after birth his mother dies. She dies because she must bear no other being. The Bodhisatta’s time of conception is so calculated that the mother’s destined life span completes itself seven days after his birth. From the Commentary (DA.ii.437; UdA.278) account it would appear that the age of the Bodhisatta’s mother at the time of his birth is between fifty and sixty (majjhimavayassa pana dve kotthāsā atikkamma tatiyekotthāse).<br>The Bodhisatta’s last birth is attended by various miracles. The Commentaries see, in the various incidents connected with the Bodhisatta’s last birth, signs of various features, which came, later, to be associated with the Buddha and his doctrine; for details see DA.ii.439ff.<br>Soothsayers, being summoned, see on the child’s body the thirty two marks of a Great Man (mahāpurisa), (for details of these see D.ii.17ff.; M.ii.136f. The reasons for these marks are given at D.iii.145ff ) and declare that the child will become either a Cakkavatti or a Buddha. His father, desiring that his child shall be a Cakkavatti rather than a Buddha, brings him up in great luxury, hiding from him all the sin and ugliness of the world. But the destiny of a Bodhisatta asserts itself, and he becomes aware of the presence in the world of old age, disease, death and the freedom of mind to be found in the life of a Recluse. In the case of some Bodhisattas (e.g., Vipassī) these four signs (nimittāni as they are called) are seen by them at different times, but in the case of others on one and the same day (DA.ii.457).<br>Urged by the desire to discover the cause of suffering in the world and the way out of it, the Bodhisatta leaves the world on the day of his son’s birth.<br>Some Bodhisattas leave the world riding on an elephant (e.g., Dīpankara, Sumana, Sumedha, Phustsa, Sikhī and Konāgamana), some on a chariot (e.g., Kondañña, Revata, Paduma, Piyadassī, and Kakusandha), some on a horse (e.g., Maṅgala, Sujāta, Atthadassī, Tissa, Gotama), and some in a palanquin (e.g., Anomadassī, Siddhattha and Vessabhū). Some, like Nārada, go on foot, while Sobhita, Dhammadassī and Kassapa travelled in the palaces of their lay life.Having left the world, the Bodhisatta practises the austerities, the period of such practices varying.<br>In the case of Dīpankara, Kondañña, Sumana, Anomadassī, Sujāta, Siddhattha and Kakusandha it was ten months; for Maṅgala, Sumedha, Tissa and Sikhī it was eight; for Revata seven; for Piyadassī, Phussa, Vessabhū and Konāgamana six; for Sobhita four; for Paduma, Atthadassī and Vipassī two weeks; for Nārada, Padumuttara, Dhammadassī and Kassapa one week; and for Gotama six years (for the reason for this great length in the last case, see Gotama). On the day the Bodhisatta attains to Buddhahood, he receives a meal of milk rice (pāyāsa) from a woman and a gift of kusagrass, generally from an ājīvīka, which he spreads under the Bodhi-tree (the Bodhi tree is different for each Bodhisatta) for his seat. The size of this seat varies;<br>the seats of Dīpankara, Revata, Piyadassī, Atthadassī, Dhammadassī and Vipassī were fifty-three hands in length; those of Kondañña, Maṅgala, Nārada and Sumedha fifty seven hands; that of Sumana sixty hands; those of Sobhita, Anomadassī, Paduma, Padumuttara and Phussa thirty eight; of Sujāta thirty two; of Kakusandha twenty six; of Konāgamana twenty; of Kassapa fifteen; of Gotama fourteen (BuA. 247). Before the Enlightenment the Bodhisatta has five great dreams:<br>(1) that the world is his couch with the Himālaya as his pillow, his left hand resting on the eastern sea, his right on the western, and his feet on the southern; (2) that a blade of tiriyā(kusa) grass growing from his navel touches the clouds; (3) that white worms with black heads creep up from his feet, covering his knees; (4) that four birds of varied hues from the four quarters of the world fall at his feet and become white; (5) that he walks to and fro on a heap of dung, by which he remains unsoiled. For the explanations of these dreams see A.iii.240f.; these dreams are referred to at J.i.69.<br>The next day the Bodhisatta sits cross legged on his seat facing the east, determined not to rise till he has attained his goal. The gods of all the worlds assemble to do him honour, but Māra (q.v.) comes with his mighty hosts and the gods flee. All day, the fight continues between Māra and the Bodhisatta; the pārami alone are present to lend their aid to the Bodhisatta, and when the moment comes, the Goddess of the Earth bears witness to his great sacrifices, while Māra and his armies retire discomfited at the hour of sunset, the gods then returning and singing a paean of victory. Meanwhile the Bodhisatta spends the night in deep concentration; during the first watch he requires knowledge of past lives, during the second watch he develops the divine eye, while during the last watch he ponders over and comprehends the Paticca-samuppāda doctrine. Backwards and forwards his mind travels over the chain of causation and twelve times the earth trembles. With sunrise, omniscience dawns on him, and he becomes the Supremely Awakened Buddha, uttering his udānā of victory, while the whole world rejoices with him.<br>For the Paticca-Samuppada see D.ii.31ff.; for the other details see J.i.56ff., where the story of Gotama is given. DA.ii.462ff gives similar details regarding Vipassī; BuA.248 says it is the same for all Bodhisattas.<br>The above is a brief account, as given in the books, of certain features common to all Bodhisattas. In addition to these, particulars of the personal career of the Bodhisatta who became Gotama, are found, chiefly in the Buddhavamsa and the Jātakaṭṭhakathā. It has already been stated that each Bodhisatta receives the vyākarana from every Buddha whom he meets, and Gotama was no exception.<br>He received his first vyākarana as the ascetic Sumedha, from Dīpankara; and then, as a cakkavatti, from Kondañña; as the brahmin Suruci, from Maṅgala; as the Nāga king Atula, from Sumana; as the brahmin Atideva, from Revata; as the brahmin Ajita, from Sobhita; as a yakkha chief, from Anomadassī; as a lion, from Paduma; as an ascetic (isi) from Nārada; as a governor (Mahāratthiya) Jatila, from Padumuttara; as the youth Uttara, from Sumedha; as a Cakkavatti, from Sujāta; as the youth Kassapa, from Piyadassī; as the ascetic Susīma, from Atthadassī; as Sakka, from Dhammadassī; as the ascetic Maṅgala, from Siddhattha; as Sujāta, from Tissa; as King Vijitāvī, from Phussa; as the Nāga king Atula, from Vipassī; as King Arindama, from Sikhī; as King Sudassana, from Vessabhū; as King Khema, from Kakusandha; as King Pabbata, from Konāgamana; and as the youth Jotipāla, from Kassapa.The Jātakaṭṭhakathā gives particulars of other births of the Bodhisatta (to the births given below and taken from the Jātakaṭṭhakathā should be added those given in the Pubbapilotikhanda of the Apadāna i.299ff.; also UdA, and given Gotama ) e.g., as<br>Akitti, Ajjuna, Atthisena, Anitthigandha, Ayoghara, Araka, Arindama, Alīnacitta, Alīnasattu, Asadisa, ādāsamukha, Udaya, Udayabhadda, Katthavāhana, Kanhadīpāyana, Kanhapaṇḍita, Kapila, Kappa, Kassapa, Kārandiya, Kālingabhāradvāja, Kunāla, Kundakumāra, Kuddālaka, Kusa, Komāyaputta, Khadiravaniya, Guttila, Ghata, Canda, Candakumāra, Campeyya, Cittapaṇḍita, Cullaka setthi, Culladhanuggaha, Chaddanta, Chalaṅgakumāra, Janasandha.

The Bodhisatta was born<br>as a candāla in several births (e.g., as Citta and Mātaṅga); in several instances as Sakka, (e.g.in the Kāmanīta, Kelisīla, Mahāpanāda and Vaka Jātakas;). He was born several times in the deva world (e.g. as Dhamma and Bhaddasāla, also in the Kakkāru, Kāmavilāpa and Mittavinda Jātakas.) He was a Brahmā of the ābhassara world (Candābha and Janasodhana Jātakas); and a Mahābrahmā (Parosahassa and Mahānārada Kassapa), in the latter his name was Nārada. He was an air sprite (Puppharatta Jātaka) and a mountain sprite (e.g. Kāka and Samudda Jātakas); a treesprite in numerous births (e.g. āyācitabhatta, Baka, Matakabhatta, Rukkhadhamma Jātakas); and a forest sprite (Kandina and Gūthapāna Jātakas). Many Jātakas mention the birth of the Bodhisatta among animals - e.g.,<br>as buffalo (Mahisia Jātaka); bull (as Ayyakālaka, Nandivisāla, Mahālohita, Sārambha); cock (in the two Kukkuta Jātakas, Nos. 383, 448); crow (as Vīraka and Supatta and in Kāka Jātaka); dog (Kukkura Jātaka); elephant (e.g., Chaddanta and Sīlava Jātakas;); fish (Mitacintī); frog (Haritamāta Jātaka); garuda (e.g., Sussondi Jātaka); goose (e.g. Ulūka, Cakkavāka, Neru, Palāsa Jātakas); hare (Sasa Jātaka); horse (ājañña, Bhogājānīya Jātakas and as Vātaggasindhava); iguana (Godha Jātaka); jackal (Sigāla Jātakas); kinnara (as Canda); lion (e.g., Guna, Sigāla Jātaka (No.152), Sūkara Jātakas); mallard (Nacca Jātaka); monkey (Kapi, Nalapāna, Mahākapi, Sumsumāra Jātakas and as Nandyia); parrot (e.g. as Jambuka, Pupphaka, Potthapāda, and Rādha); peacock (Nos. 42, 375, Mora, Bāveru, and Mahāmora Jātakas); pig (Mahātuṇḍila Jātakas); pigeon (Kapota, Kāka No.395, Romaka, Lola Jātakas); quail (the three Vattaka, and Sammodamāna Jātakas); rat (Aggika and Bilāra Jātakas); snake – nāga (as Cāmpeyya, Bhuridatta, Mahādaddara, Sankhapāla); vulture (as Aparanna and in the three Gijjha Jātakas, Nos. 164, 399, 427), and woodpecker (as Khadiravaniya and in Javasakuna Jātaka).The Bodhisatta was born several times in the purgatories (Ap.i.299 ff). The wishes of Bodhisattas are generally fulfilled (J.iii.283; v.282, 291; vi. 401, 405, etc.), chiefly because of their great wisdom (J.iii.282) and zeal (J.iii.425). The wisdom of a Bodhistatta is greater than that of a Pacceka Buddha (J.iv.341).<br>See also Buddha.'],

'bojjhaṅga':['’the 7 factors of enlightenment’, are:<br>mindfulness (sati-sambojjhaṅga; s. sati), investigation of the law(dhamma-vicaya-sambojjhaṅga), energy (viriya-sambojjhaṅga; s. viriya, padhāna), rapture (pīti-sambojjhaṅga, q.v.) tranquility (passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga,q.v.), concentration (samādhi-sambojjhaṅga, q.v.), equanimity (upekkhā). ”Because they lead to enlightenment, therefore they are called factors of enlightenment” (S. XLVI, 5).<br>Though in the 2nd factor, dhamma-vicaya, the word dhamma is taken by most translators to stand for the Buddhist doctrine, it probably refers to the bodily and mental phenomena (nāma-rūpa-dhammā) as presented to the investigating mind by mindfulness, the 1st factor. With that interpretation, the term may be rendered by ’investigation of phenomena’.<br>In A.X.102, the 7 factors are said to be the means of attaining the threefold wisdom (s. tevijjā).<br>They may be attained by means of the 4 foundations of mindfulness (satipatthāna), as it is said in S.XLVI.1 and explained in M.118:<br>(1) ”Whenever, o monks, the monk dwells contemplating the body (kāya), feeling (vedanā), mind (citta) and mind-objects (dhammā), streṇuous, clearly-conscious, mindful, after subduing worldly greed and grief, at such a time his mindfulness is present and undisturbed; and whenever his mindfulness is present and undisturbed, at such a time he has gained and is developing the factor of enlightenment ’mindfulness’(sati-sambojjhaṅga), and thus this factor of enlightenment reaches fullest perfection.<br>(2) ”Whenever, while dwelling with mindfulness, he wisely investigates, examines and thinks over the law ... at such a time he has gained and is developing the factor of enlightenment ’investigation of the law’ (dhamma-vicaya°) ....<br>(3) ”Whenever, while wisely investigating his energy is firm and unshaken ... at such a time he has gained and is developing the factor of enlightenment ’energy’ (viriya°) ....<br>(4) ”Whenever in him, while firm in energy, arises super sensuous rapture ... at such a time he has gained and is developing the factor of enlightenment ’rapture’ (pīti°) ..<br>(5) ”Whenever, while enraptured in mind, his body and his mind become composed ... at such a time he has gained and is developing the factor of enlightenment ’tranquillity’ (passaddhi°).<br>(6) ”Whenever, while being composed in his body and happy, his mind becomes concentrated ... at such a time he has gained and is developing the factor of enlightenment ’concentration’ (samādhi°)<br>(7) ”Whenever he looks with complete indifference on his mind thus concentrated ... at such a time he has gained and is developing the factor of enlightenment ’equanimity’ (upekkhā).<br>Literature:<br>Bojjhaṅga Samyutta (S.

'brahmadatta jātaka':['Once, the Bodhisatta, after studying at Takkasilā, became an ascetic in the Himālaya, visitedUttarapañcāla, and resided in the garden of the Pañcāla king. The king saw him begging for alms, invited him into the palace and, having shown him great honour, asked him to stay in the park. When the time came for the Bodhisatta to return to the Himālaya, he wished for a pair of single soled shoes and a leaf parasol. But for twelve years he could not summon up enough courage to ask the king for these things! He could only get as far as telling the king he had a favour to ask, and then his heart failed him, for, he said to himself, it made a man weep to have to ask and it made a man weep to have to refuse. In the end the king noticed his discomfiture and offered him all his possessions; but the ascetic would take only the shoes and the parasol, and, with these, he left for the Himālaya.<br>The king is identified with Ananda.

Other names for it are Atthajāla, Dhammajāla, Ditthijāla, and Sangāmavijaya. At the end of the discourse the ten world systems trembled (D.i.46). It is said that once when Pinndapātiya Thera recited this sutta at the Kalyāniya vihāra, his mind concentrated on the Buddha, the earth trembled; the same phenomenon occurred when the Dīghabhānaka Theras recited it at the Ambahtthikā, to the east of the Lohapāsāda (DA.i.131).<br>The Brahmaj’āla was the first sutta preached in Suvannabhūmi, when Sona and Uttara visited it as missionaries (Mhv.xii.51).<br>The Sutta is often quoted, sometimes even in the Canon.

Baka himself agrees with the Buddha, who tells him of planes of existence of which Baka knows nothing. Baka then says that he will vanish from the Buddha’s presence, but finds himself unable to do so. The Buddha then vanishes and repeats a stanza for the Brahmās to hear. Baka admits defeat, but Māra again enters into a Brahmā and asks the Buddha not to communicate his doctrine to others.

Uttara therefore visited the Buddha and, having seen the thirty two marks, resolved to observe the Buddha in his every posture and, to this end, followed him about for seven months. He then returned to Brahmāyu and told him of the result of his investigations. Brahmāyu folded his palms reverently and uttered the praises of the Buddha. Soon after, the Buddha came to Mithilā and took up his residence in the Makhādeva ambavana. Brahmāyu, having sent a messenger to announce his arrival, visited the Buddha.<br>It is said that all those present rose to greet him, but Brahmāyu signed to them to be seated. He satisfied any remaining doubts he had as to the marks on the Buddha’s body and then proceeded to ask him questions on various topics. At the end of the discussion he fell at the Buddha’s feet, stroking them and proclaiming his name. The Buddha asked him to compose himself, and preached to him on ”progressive” discourse. Brahmāyu invited the Buddha and his monks to his house, where he entertained them for a week. His death occurred not long after, and the Buddha, when told of it, said that Brahmāyu had become an Anāgāmī (M.ii.133ff). Brahmāyu’s salutation of the Buddha is described as panipāta. ItvA.177.'],

Ananda tells him that the life of a recluse has for its object the abandonment of desire and that this is brought about by the cultivation of the four iddhi-pādas.

The Buddha dismisses their question and teaches them that it is not by trying to walk to the end of the world that the end of the world can be reached, but by understanding the five strands of sense-desire (kāmaguṇa).

'brāhmanatissa-cora':['Reference is made in the Ceylon Chronicles and in some of the Commentaries to a period of great distress in Ceylon, owing to the activities of a cora (? brigand) called Brāhmanatissa in the time of Vattagāmaṇī-Abhaya (Pitirājā).<br>According to the Mahāvamsa and the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (Mhv.xxxiii.37ff.; MT.613), Tissa was a brahmin youth of Rohana. One day he heard a brahmin soothsayer announce that if a brigand were to commence his activities under a certain combination of planets, he would conquer the whole of Ceylon. Tissa, acting on this idea, turned robber and sent word to the king that he should hand over his throne to him. At the same time seven Damilas, with their followers, arrived in Mahātittha with the same demand. The king thereupon sent word to Tissa that the kingdom would be his if he could defeat the Damilas. Tissa agreed to this and marched against them, but was taken captive in a battle near Sanketahāla. The Pāli Commentaries give further details. Tissa plundered the land for twelve long years; food became so scarce that, owing to starvation, people lost even their sexual desires, and the birth of a child was such a rare occurrence that all the land rejoiced over such a birth (SA.ii.83). Tissa’s activities were at their height when Vattagāmaṇī was in hiding. The stores of food in Cittalapabbata vihāra and in Tissamahārāma were laid waste by enormous rats and the monks could obtain no food, Tissa having ravished the land. They therefore sent eight Theras to Sakka, begging him to rid the country of Tissa; but Sakka sent reply that he was powerless, and suggested that the monks should go over the seas. Some took his advice and sailed from Jambukola, but the leaders of the community - Samyuttabhānaka Cūlasīva, Isidatta and Mahāsona - remained behind awaiting better times (see also Nāgā Therī, whose story given in AA.ii.654f.; also MA.i.546). The Mahāvihāra at Anurādhapura was deserted; the Mahā Thūpa was overgrown with trees. The monks had to live on lotus stalks and fruit rinds thrown away by the people. When Brāhmanatissa died, Vattagāmaṇī once more came to the throne (VibhA.445-51). v.l. Brāhmanatiya cora (from which the Ceylon Chronicles derive the form Bāminitiyā). About the date of the Bāminisāya (the brahmin famine as it was called in Sinhalese), see Cv. Trs.

'budalavitthi':['A village in Ceylon where Vijayabāhu I. erected five dwelling places for the monks on the spot where his parents had been cremated. Cv.lx.57.'],
'buddha':['A generic name, an appellative - but not a proper name - given to one who has attained Enlightenment (na mātarā katam, na pitarā katam – vimokkhantikam etam buddhānam bhagavantānam bodhiyā mūle ... paññatti, MNid.458; Ps.i.174) a man superior to all other beings, human and divine, by his knowledge of the Truth (Dhamma).<br>The texts mention two kinds of Buddha: viz.,<br>Pacceka Buddhas - i.e., Buddhas who also attain to complete Enlightenment but do not preach the way of deliverance to the world; and Sammāsambuddhas, who are omniscient and are teachers of Nibbāna (Satthāro). The Commentaries, however (e.g., SA.i.20; AA.i.65) make mention of four classes of Buddha:<br>Sabaññu-Buddhā Pacceka Buddhā Catusacca Buddhā Suta BuddhāAll arahants (khīnāsavā) are called Catusacca Buddhā and all learned men Bahussuta Buddhā. A Pacceka Buddha practises the ten perfections (pāramitā) for two asankheyyas and one hundred thousand kappas, a Sabbañu Buddha practises it for one hundred thousand kappas and four or eight or sixteen asankheyyas, as the case may be (see below).<br>Seven Sabbaññu Buddhas are mentioned in the earlier books; these are<br>Vīpassī Sikhī Vessabhū Kakusandha Konāgamana Kassapa GotamaE.g., D.ii.5f.; S.ii.5f.; cp. Thag.491; J.ii.147; they are also mentioned at Vin.ii.110, in an old formula against snake bites. Beal (Catena, p. 159) says these are given in the Chinese Pātimokkha. They are also found in the Sayambhū Purāna (Mitra, Skt. Buddhist Lit. of Nepal, p. 249).<br>This number is increased in the later books. The Buddhavamsa contains detailed particulars of twenty five Buddhas, including the last, Gotama, the first twenty four being those who prophesied Gotama’s appearance in the world. They are the predecessors of Vipassī, etc., and are the following:<br>Dīpankara, Kondañña, Maṅgala, Sumana, Revata, Sobhita, Anomadassī, Paduma, Nārada, Padumuttara, Sumedha, Sujāta, Piyadassī, Atthadassī, Dhammadassī, Siddhattha, Tissa and Phussa. The same poem, in its twenty seventh chapter, mentions three other Buddhas - Tanhankara, Medhankara and Saranankara - who appeared in the world beforeDīpankara.<br>The Lalitavistara has a list of fifty four Buddhas and the Mahāvastu of more than a hundred. The Cakkavatti Sīhanāda Sutta (D.iii.75ff ) gives particulars of Metteyya Buddha who will be born in the world during the present kappa. TheAnāgatavamsa gives a detailed account of him. Some MSS. of that poem (J.P.T.S. 1886, p. 37) mention the names of ten future Buddhas, all of whom met Gotama who prophesied about them. These are Metteyya, Uttama, Rāma, Pasenadi Kosala, Abhibhū, Dīghasonī, Sankacca, Subha, Todeyya, Nālāgiripalaleyya (sic).<br>The Mahāpadāna Sutta (D.ii.5f ) which mentions the seven Buddhas gives particulars of each under eleven heads (paricchedā) -<br>the kappa in which he is born, his social rank (jāti), his family (gotta), length of life at that epoch (āyu), the tree under which he attains Enlightenment (bodhi), the names of his two chief disciples (sāvakayuga), the numbers present at the assemblies of arahants held by him (sāvakasannipāta), the name of his personal attendant (upatthākabhikkhu), the names of his father and mother and of his birthplace. The Commentary (DA.ii.422ff) adds to these other particulars -<br>the names of his son and his wife before his Renunciation, the conveyance (yāna) in which he leaves the world, the monastery in which his Gandhakuti was placed, the amount of money paid for its purchase, the site of the monastery, and the name of his chief lay patron. In the case of Gotama, the further fact is stated that on the day of his birth there appeared also in the world Rāhulamātā,Ananda, Kanthaka, Nidhikumbhi (Treasure Trove), the Mahābodhi and Kāludāyī.<br>Gotama was conceived under the asterism (nakkhatta) of Uttarāsāḷha, under which asterism he also made his Renunciation (Da.ii425), preached his first sermon and performed the Twin Miracle. Under the asterism ofVisākha he was born, attained Enlightenment and died; under that of Māgha he held his first assembly of arahants and decided to die; under Assayuja he descended from Tāvatimsa.<br>The Buddhavamsa Commentary says (BuA.2f) that in the Buddhavamsa particulars of each Buddha are given under twenty two heads, the additional heads being the details of the first sermon, the numbers of those attaining realization of truth (abhisamaya) at each assembly, the names of the two chief women disciples, the aura of the Buddha’s body (ramsi), the height of his body, the name of the Bodhisatta (who was to become Gotama Buddha), the prophecy concerning him, his exertions (padhāna) and the details of each Buddha’s death. The Commentary also says that mention must be made of the time each Buddha lived as a householder, the names of the palaces he occupied, the number of his dancing women, the names of his chief wife, and his son, his conveyance, his reṇunciation, his practice of austerities, his patrons and his monastery.<br>There are eight particulars in which the Buddhas differ from each other (atthavemattāni). These are length of life in the epoch in which each is born, the height of his body, his social rank (some are born as khattiyas, others as brahmins), the length of his austerities, the aura of his body (thus, in the case of Maṅgala, his aura spread throughout the ten thousand world systems, while that of Gotama extended only one fathom; - but when he wishes, a Buddha can spread his aura at will, BuA.106); the conveyance in which he makes his reṇunciation, the tree under which he attains Enlightenment, and the size of the seat (pallanka) under the Bodhi tree.<br>Only the first five are mentioned in DA.ii.424; also at BuA.105; all eight are given at BuA.246f., which also gives details under each of the eight heads, regarding all the twenty five Buddhas.<br>In the case of all Buddhas, there are four fixed spots (avijahitatthānāni). These are:<br>the site of the seat under the Bodhi tree (bodhipallanka), the Deer Park at Isipatana where the first sermon is preached, the spot where the Buddha first steps on the ground at Sankassa on his descent from Tusita (Tāvatimsa?) the spots marked by the four posts of the bed in the Buddha’s Gandhakuti in Jetavana. The monastery may vary in size; the site of the city in which it stands may also vary, but not the site of the bed. Sometimes it is to the east of the vihāra, sometimes to the north (DA.ii.424; BuA.247).<br>Thirty facts are mentioned as being true of all Buddhas (samatimsavidhā dhammatā).<br>In his last life every Bodhisatta is conscious at the moment of his conception; in his mother’s womb he remains cross legged with his face turned outwards; his mother gives birth to him in a standing posture; the birth takes place in a forest grove (araññe); immediately after birth he takes seven steps to the north and roars the ”lion’s roar”; he makes his reṇunciation after seeing the four omens and after a son is born to him; he has to practise austerities for at least seven days after donning the yellow robe; he has a meal of milk rice on the day of his Enlightenment; he attains to omniscience seated on a carpet of grass; he practises concentration in breathing; he defeats Māra’s forces; he attains to supreme perfection in all knowledge and virtue at the foot of the Bodhi tree; Mahā Brahmā requests him to preach the Dhamma; he preaches his first sermon in the Deer Park at Isipatana; he recites the Pātimokkha to the fourfold assembly on the full moon day of Māgha; he resides chiefly in Jetavana, he performs the Twin Miracle in Sāvatthi; he preaches the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa; he descends from there at the gate of Sankassa; he constantly lives in the bliss of phalasamāpatti; he investigates the possibility of converting others during two jhānas; he lays down the precepts only when occasion arises for them; he relates Jātakas when suitable occasions occur; he recites the Buddhavamsa in the assembly of his kinsmen; he always greets courteously monks who visit him; he never leaves the place where he has spent the rainy season without bidding farewell to his hosts; each day he has prescribed duties before and after his meal and during the three watches of the night; he eats a meal containing flesh (mamsarajabhojana) immediately before his death; and just before his death he enters into the twenty four crores and one hundred thousand samāpattī. There are also mentioned four dangers from which all Buddhas are immune:<br>no misfortune can befall the four requisites intended for a Buddha; no one can encompass his death; no injury can befall any of his thirty two Mahāpurisalakkhanā or eighty anubyañjanā; nothing can obstruct his aura (BuA.248). A Buddha is born only in this Cakkavāla out of the ten thousand Cakkavālas which constitute the jātikkhetta (AA.i.251; DA.iii.897). There can appear only one Buddha in the world at a time (D.ii.225; D.iii.114; the reasons for this are given in detail in Mil. 236, and quoted in DA.iii.900f). No Buddha can arise until the sāsana of the previous Buddha has completely disappeared from the world. This happens only with the dhātuparinibbāna (see below). When a Bodhisatta takes conception in his mother’s womb in his last life, after leaving Tusita, there is manifested throughout the world a wonderful radiance, and the ten thousand world systems tremble.<br>Similar earthquakes appear when he is born, when he attains Enlightenment, when he preaches the first sermon, when he decides to die, when he finally does so (D.ii.108f.; cp. DA.iii.897).<br>The Mahāpādāna Sutta (D.ii.12-15) and the Acchariya-bbhuta-dhamma Sutta (M.iii.119-124) contain accounts of other miracles, which attend the conception and birth of a Buddha. Later books (e.g., J.i.) have greatly enlarged these accounts. They describe how the Bodhisatta, having practised the thirty Pāramī, and made the five great gifts (pañcamahāpariccāgā), and thus reached the pinnacle of the threefold cariyā - ñātattha-cariyā, lokattha-cariyā and buddhi-cariyā - gives the seven mahādānā, as in the case ofVessantara, making the earth tremble seven times, and is born after death in Tusita.<br>The Bodhisatta, who later became Vipassī Buddha, remained in Tusita during the whole permissible period - fifty seven crores and sixty seven thousand years. But most Bodhisattas leave Tusita before completing the full span of life there. Five signs appear to warn the devaputta that his end is near (seeDeva); the gods of the ten thousand worlds gather round him, beseeching him to be born on earth that he may become the Buddha. The Bodhisatta thereupon makes the five investigations (pañcamahāvilokanāni).<br>Sometimes only one Buddha is born in a kappa, such a kappa being called Sārakappa; sometimes two, Mandakappa; sometimes three, Vārakappa; sometimes four, Sāramandakappa; rarely five, Bhaddakappa (BuA.158f). No Buddha is born in the early period of a kappa, when men live longer than one hundred thousand years and are thus not able to recognize the nature of old age and death, and therefore not able to benefit by his preaching. When the life of man is too short, there is no time for exhortation and men are full of kilesa. The suitable age for a Buddha is, therefore, when men live not less than one hundred years and not more than ten thousand. The Bodhisatta must first consider the continent and the country of birth. Buddhas are born only inJambudīpa, and there, too, only in theMajjhimadesa. He must then consider the family; Buddhas are born only in brahmin or khattiya families, whichever is more esteemed during that particular age. Then he must think of the mother: she must be wise and virtuous; and her life must be destined to end seven days after the Buddha’s birth.<br>Having made these decisions, the Bodhisatta goes toNandanavana in Tusita, and while wandering about there ”falls away” from Tusita and takes conception. He is aware of his death but unaware of his cuti-citta or dying thought. The Commentators seem to have differed as to whether there is awareness of conception. When the Bodhisatta is conceived, his mother has no further wish for indulgence in sexual pleasure. For seven days previously she observes the uposatha vows, but there is no mention of a virgin birth; the birth might be called parthenogenetic (see Mil.123).<br>On the day of the actual conception, the mother, having bathed in scented water after the celebration of the Asāḷha festival, and having eaten choice food, takes upon herself the uposatha vows and retires to the adorned state bedchamber. As she sleeps, she dreams that the Four Regent Gods raise her with her bed, and, having taken her to the Himālaya, bathe her in LakeAnotatta, robe her in divine clothes, anoint her with perfumes and deck her with heavenly flowers (according to the Nidānakathā, J.i.50, it is their queens who do these things, re the Bodhisatta assuming the form of an elephant, see Dial.ii.116n). Not far away is a silver mountain and on it a golden mansion. There they lay her with her head to the east. The Bodhisatta, assuming the form of a white elephant, enters her room, and after circling right wise three times round her bed, smites her right side with his trunk and enters her womb. She awakes and tells her husband of her dream. Soothsayers are consulted, and they prophesy the birth of aCakka-vatti or of a Buddha.<br>The two Suttas mentioned above speak of the circumstances obtaining during the time spent by the child in his mother’s womb. It is said (DA.ii.437) that the Bodhisatta is born when his mother is in the last third of her middle age. This is in order that the birth may be easy for both mother and child. Various miracles attend the birth of the Bodhisatta. The Commentaries expound, at great length, the accounts of these miracles given in the Suttas. Immediately after birth the Bodhisatta stands firmly on his feet, and having taken seven strides to the north, while a white canopy, is held over his head, looks round and utters in fearless voice the lion’s roar: ”Aggo ’ham asmi lokassa, jettho ’ham asmi lokassa, settho ’ham asmi lokassa, ayam antimā jāti, natthi dāni punabbhavo” (D.ii.15).<br>To the later Buddhists, not only these acts of the Bodhisatta, but every item of the miracles accompanying his birth, have their symbolical meaning. See, e.g., DA.ii.439; thus, standing on the earth means the attaining of the four iddhi-pādas; facing north implies the spiritual conquest of multitudes; the seven strides are the seven bojjhaṅgas; the canopy is the umbrella of emancipation; looking round means unveiled knowledge; fearlessness denotes the irrevocable turning of the Wheel of the Law; the mention of the last birth, the arahantship he will attain in this life, etc.<br>There seems to have been a difference of opinion among the Elders of the Sangha as to what happened when the Bodhisatta took his seven strides northwards. Did he walk on the earth or travel through the air? Did people see him go? Was he clothed? Did he look an infant or an adult? Tipitaka Culābhaya, preaching on the first floor of the Lohapāsāda, settled the question by suggesting a compromise: the Bodhisatta walked on earth, but the onlookers felt he was travelling through the air; he was naked, but the onlookers felt he was gaily adorned; he was an infant, but looked sixteen years old; and after his roar he reverted to infancy! (DA.ii.442)<br>After birth, the Bodhisatta is presented to the soothsayers for their prognostications and they reassert that two courses alone are open to him either to be a Cakka-vatti or a Buddha. They also discover on his body the thirty two marks of the Great Man (Mahāpurisa) (These are given at D.ii.17 19; also M.ii.136f). The Bodhisatta has also the eighty secondary signs (asīti anubyañjana) such as copper coloured nails glossy and prominent, sinews which are hidden and without knots, etc. (The list is found in Lal. 121 \[106\]). The Brahmāyu Sutta (for details see M.ii.137f) gives other particulars about Gotama, which are evidently characteristic of all Buddhas. Thus, in walking he always starts with the right foot, his steps are neither too long nor too short, only his lower limbs move; when he gazes on anything, he turns right round to do so (nāgavilokana). When entering a house he never bends his body (Cp. DhA.ii.136); when sitting down, accepting water to wash his bowl, eating, washing his hands after eating, or returning thanks, he sits with the greatest propriety, dignity and thoroughness. When preaching, he neither flatters nor denounces his hearers but merely instructs them, rousing, enlightening and heartening them (M.ii.139). His voice possesses eight qualities: it is frank, clear, melodious, pleasant, full, carrying, deep and resonant; it does not travel beyond his audience (for details concerning his voice see DA.ii.452f.; and MA.ii.771f). A passage in the Anguttara (A.iv.308) says that a Buddha preaches in the eight assemblies - of nobles, brahmins, householders, recluses, devas of the Cātummahārājika world, and of Tāvatimsa, of Māras and of Brahmās. In these assemblies he becomes one of them and their language becomes his.<br>The typical career of a Buddha is illustrated in the life ofGotama. He renounces the world only after the birth of a son. This, the Commentary explains (DA.ii.422), is to prevent him from being taken for other than a human being. He sees the four omens before his Renunciation: an old man, a sick man, a dead man, and a recluse. Some Buddhas see all four on the same day, others, like Vipassī, at long intervals (DA.ii.457). On the night before the Enlightenment, the Bodhisatta dreams five dreams (A.iii.240). After the Enlightenment the Buddha does not preach till asked to do so by Mahā Brahmā. This is on order that the world may pay greater attention to the Buddha and his teaching (DA.ii.467). A Buddha generally travels from the Bodhi tree toIsipatana for his first sermon, through the air, but Gotama went on foot because he wished to meet Upaka on the way (DA.ii.471).<br>The Buddha’s day is divided into periods, each of which has its distinct duties (DA.i.45f; SNA.i.131f, etc.). He rises early, and having attended to his bodily functions, sits in solitude till the time arrives for the alms round. He then puts on his outer robe and goes for alms, sometimes alone, sometimes with a large following of monks. When he wishes to go alone he keeps the door of his cell shut, which sign is understood by the monks (Ibid., 271). Occasionally he goes long distances for alms, travelling through the air, and then only khīnāsavā are allowed to accompany him (ThagA.i.65). Sometimes he goes in the ordinary way (pakatiyā), sometimes accompanied by many miracles. After the meal he returns to his cell; this is the pure bhattakicca.<br>Having washed his feet, he would emerge from his cell, talk to the monks and admonish them. To those who ask for subjects of meditation, he would give them according to their temperament. He would then retire to his cell and, if he so desire, sleep for a while. After that, he looks around the world with his divine eye, seeking whom he may serve, and would then preach to those who come to him for instruction. In the evening he would bathe, and then, during the first watch, attend to monks seeking his advice. The middle watch is spent with devas and others who visit him to question him. The last watch is divided into three parts: the first part is spent in walking about for exercise and meditation; the second is devoted to sleep; and the third to contemplation, during which those who are capable of benefiting by the Buddha’s teaching, through good deeds done by them in the past, come into his vision. Only beings that are veneyyā (capable of benefiting by instruction) and who possess upanissaya, appear before the Buddha’s divine eye (DA.ii.470).<br>The Buddha gives his visitors permission to ask what they will. This is called Sabbaññupavāraṇa, and only a Buddha is capable of holding to this promise to answer any question (SNA.i.229). Except during the rains, the Buddha spends his time in wandering from place to place, gladdening men and inciting them to lead the good life. This wandering is called cārikā and is of two kinds - turita and aturita. The first is used for a long journey accomplished by him in a very short time, for the benefit of some particular person. Thus Gotama travelled three gāvutas to meet Mahā Kassapa, thirty yojanas to see Alavaka andAngulimāla, forty five yojanas to seePukusāti, etc. In the case of aturita cārikā progress is slow. The range of a Buddha’s cārikā varies from year to year. Sometimes he would tour the Mahāmandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes the Majjhimamandala of nine hundred yojanas, sometimes only the Antomandala of six hundred yojanas. A tour of the Mahāmandala occupies nine months, that of the Majjhimamandala eight, and that of the Antomandala from one to four months. Details of the cārikā and the reasons for them are given at length in DA.i.240 3. When the Buddha cannot go on a journey himself, he sends his chief disciples (SNA.ii.474). The Buddha announces his intention of undertaking a journey two weeks before he starts, so that the monks may get ready (DhA.ii.167).<br>The Buddha is omniscient, not in the sense that he knows everything, but that he could know anything should he so desire (see MNid.178,179; see also MNidA.223; SNA.i.18.). His ñāña is one of the four illimitables (neither can the Buddha’s body be measured for purposes of comparison with other bodies, MA.ii.790). He converts people in one of three ways:<br>by exhibition of miraculous powers (iddhipātihāriya), by reading their thoughts (ādesanāpātihāriya), or teaching them what is beneficial to them according to their character and temperament (anusāsanīpātihāriya). It is the last method, which the Buddha most often uses (BuA.81) The Buddha’s rivals say that he possesses the power of fascination (āvattanīmāyā); but this is untrue, as sometimes (e.g., in the case of the Kosambi monks) he cannot make even his own disciples obey him. Some beings, however, can be converted only by a Buddha. They are called buddha veneyyā (SNA.i.331). Some are pleased by the Buddha’s looks, others by his voice and words, yet others by his austerities, such as the wearing of simple robes, etc.; and finally, those whose standard of judgment is goodness, reflect that he is without a peer (DhA.iii.113f.).<br>Though the Buddha’s teaching is never really lost on the listener, he sometimes preaches knowing that it will be of no immediate benefit (see, e.g.,Udumbarikasīhanāda Sutta, D.iii.57). It is said that wherever a monk dwells during the Buddha’s time, in the vicinity of the Buddha, he would always have ready a special seat for the Buddha because it is possible that the Buddha would pay him a special visit (DA.i.48). Sometimes the Buddha will send a ray of light from his Gandhakuti to encourage a monk engaged in meditation and, appearing before him in this ray of light, preach to him. Stanzas so preached are called obhāsagāthā (SNA.i.16, 265).<br>Every Buddha founds an Order; the first pātimokkhuddesagāthā of every Buddha is the same (DA.ii.479). The attainment of arahantship is always the aim of the Buddha’s instruction (DA.iii.732). Beings can obtain the four abhiññā only during the lifetime of a Buddha (AA.i.204). A Buddha has ten powers (balāni) which consist of his perfect comprehension in ten fields of knowledge,<br>A.v.32f.; M.i.69, etc. At S.ii.27f., ten similar powers are given as consisting of his knowledge of thePaticasamuppāda. The powers of a disciple are distinct from those of a Buddha (Kvu.228); they are seven (see, e.g., D.iii.283) and physical strength equal to that of one hundred thousand crores of elephants (BuA.37). He alone can digest the food of the devas or food which contains the ojā put into it by the devas. No one else can eat with impunity the food which has been set apart for the Buddha (SNA.i.154). Besides these excellences, a Buddha possesses the four assurances (vesārajjāni, given at M.i.71f)), the eighteen āvenikadhammā*, and the sixteen anuttariyas**.<br>*Described at Lal. 183, 343, Buddhaghosa also gives (at DA.iii.994) a list of eighteen buddhadhammā, but they are all concerned with the absence of duccarita in the case of the Buddha.<br>**Given by Sāriputta in the Sampasādāniya Sutta (D.iii.102ff.).<br>The remembrance of former births a Buddha shares with six classes of purified beings, only in a higher degree. This faculty is possessed in ascending scale by titthiyā, pakatisāvakā, mahāsāvakā, aggasāvakā, pacceka buddhā and buddhā (E.g.,Vsm.411).<br>Every Buddha holds a Mahāsamaya, and only a Buddha is capable of preaching a series of suttas to suit the different temperaments of the mighty assembly gathered there (D.ii.255; DA.ii.682f).<br>A Buddha is not completely immune from disease (e.g.,Gotama). Every Buddha has the power of living for one whole kappa,” but no Buddha does so, his term of life being shortened by reason of climate and the food he takes (DA.ii.413).<br>The Commentary explains (DA.ii.554f.) that kappa here means āyukappa, the full span of a man’s life during that particular age. Some, like Mahāsīva Thera, maintained that if the Buddha could live for ten months, overcoming the pains of death, he could as well continue to live to the end of this Bhaddakappa. But a Buddha does not do so because he wishes to die before his body is overcome by the infirmities of old age.<br>No Buddha, however, dies till the sāsana is firmly established (D.iii.122). There are three parinibbānā in the case of a Buddha: kilesa parinibbāna, khandha parinibbāna and dhātu parinibbāna. The first takes place under the Bodhi tree, the second at the moment of the Buddha’s death, the third long after (DA.iii.899f.; for the history of Gotama’s relics see Gotama). Some Buddhas live longer than others; those that are dighāyuka have only sammukhasāvakā (disciples who hear the Doctrine from the Buddha himself), and at their death their relics are not scattered, only a single thūpa being erected over them (SNA. 194, 195). Short lived Buddhas hold the uposatha once a fortnight; others (e.g. Kassapa Buddha) may have it once in six months; yet others (e.g. Vipassī) only once in six years (ThagA.i.62).<br>After the Buddha’s death, his Doctrine is gradually forgotten. The first Pitaka to be lost is the Abhidhamma, beginning with the Patthāna and ending with the Dhammasaṅgani. Then, the Anguttara Nikāya of the Sutta Pitaka, from the eleventh to the first Nipāta; next the Samyutta Nikāya from the Cakkapeyyāla to the Oghatarana; then the Majjhima, from the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta to the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, and then the Dīgha, from the Dasuttara to the Brahmajāla. Scattered gāthā like the Sabhiyapucchā, and the āḷavakapucchā, last much longer, but they cannot maintain the sāsana. The last Pitaka to disappear is the Vinaya, the last portion being the mātikā of the Ubhatovibhaṅga (VibhA.432).<br>When a Buddha dies, his body receives the honours due to a monarch (these are detailed at D.ii.141f). It is said that on the night on which a Buddha attains Enlightenment, and on the night during which he dies, the colour of his skin becomes exceedingly bright (D.ii.134). Here we have the beginning of a legend which later grew into an account of an actual ”transfiguration” of the Buddha.<br>At all times, where a Buddha is present, no other light can shine (SNA.ii.525).<br>No Buddha is born during the samvattamānakappa, but only during the vivattamānakappa (SNA.i.51). A Bodhisatta who excels in paññā can attain Buddhahood in four asankheyyas; one who exels in saddhā, in eight, and one whose viriya is the chief factor, in sixteen (SNA.i.47f). When once a being has become a Bodhisatta there are eighteen conditions from which he is immune (SNA.i.50). The Buddha is referred to under various epithets. The Anguttara Nikāya gives one such list. There he is called Samana, Brāhmana, Vedagū, Bhisaka, Nimmala, Vimala, Ñānī and Vimutta (C.iv. 340). Buddhaghosa gives seven others: Cakkkumā, Sabbabhūtanukampī, Vihātaka, Mārasenappamaddī, Vusitavā, Vimutto and Angirasa (DA.iii.962f).<br>The Buddha generally speaks of himself as Tathāgata. This term is explained at great length in the Commentaries - e.g., DA.i.59f. His followers usually address him as Bhagavā, while others call him by his name (Gotama). In the case of Gotama Buddha, we find him also addressed as Sakka (SN. vs. 345; perhaps the equivalent of Sākya), Brahma (SN. p.91; SNA.ii.418), Mahāmuni (BuA.38) and Yakkha (M.i.386; also KS.i.262). Countless other epithets occur in the books, especially in the later ones. One very famous formula, used by Buddhists in their ritual, contains nine epithets, the formula being: Bhagavā araham sammāsambuddho, vijjācaranasampanno, sugato, lokavidū, anuttaro, purisadammasārathi, satthā devamanussānam, Buddho Bhagavā (these words are analysed and discussed in Vsm. 198 ff). It is maintained (e.g., DA.i.288) that the Buddha’s praises are limitless (aparimāna). One of his most striking characteristics, mentioned over and over again, is his love of quiet.<br>E.g., D.i.178f.; he is also fond of solitude (patissallāna), (D.ii.70; A.iv.438f.; S.v.320f., etc.). When he is in retirement it is usually akāla for visiting him (D.ii.270). There are also certain accusations, which are brought against a Buddha by his rivals, for this very love of solitude. ”It is said that his insight is ruined by this habit of seclusion. By intercourse with whom does he attain lucidity in wisdom? He is not at his ease in conducting an assembly, not ready in conversation, he is occupied only with the fringe of things. He is like a one eyed cow, walking in a circle” (D.iii.38).<br>In this his disciples followed his example (D.iii.37). The dwelling place of a Buddha is called Gandhakuti. His footprint is called Padacetiya, and this can be seen only when he so desires it. When once he wishes it to be visible, no one can erase it. He can also so will that only one particular person shall see it (DhA.iii.194). It is also said that his power of love is so great that no evil action can show its results in his presence (SNA.ii.475). A Buddha never asks for praise, but if his praises are uttered in his presence he takes no offence (ThagA.ii.42). When the Buddha is seated in some spot, none has the power of going through the air above him (SNA.i.222). He prefers to accept the invitations of poor men to a meal (DhA.ii.135).<br>See also Gotama and Bodhisatta. Also the article on Buddha in the N.P.D.<br>2. Buddha.

When a Cakkavatti is born into the world, the Cakkaratana appears before him from the Cakkadaha, travelling through the air (J.iv.232, but seeVepulla).<br>The Cakkaratana is the Cakkavatti’s chief symbol of office; on its appearance before him, he sprinkles it with water and asks it to travel to the various quarters of the world, winning them for him. This the Cakkaratana does, carrying with it through the air the Cakkavatti with his fourfold army. Wherever the Cakkaratana halts, all the chiefs of that quarter acclaim the Cakkavatti as their overlord and declare their allegiance to him. Having thus traversed the four quarters of the earth, it returns to the Cakkavatti’s capital, and remains fixed as an ornament on the open terrace in front of his inner apartments (D.ii.173f; M.iii.173ff).<br>The Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.617ff; MA.ii.942ff) contain lengthy descriptions of the Cakkaratana: it is shaped like a wheel, its nave is of sapphire, the centre of which shines like the orb of the moon, and round it is a band of silver. It has one thousand spokes, each ornamented with various decorations; its tyre is of bright coral; within every tenth spoke is a coral staff, hollow inside, which produces the sounds of the fivefold musical instruments when blown upon by the wind. On the staff is a white parasol, on either side of which are festoons of flowers. When the wheel moves, it appears like three wheels moving one within the other.<br>When a Cakkavatti dies or leaves the world, the Cakkaratana disappears from the sight of men for seven days; it gives warning of a Cakkavatti’s impending death by slipping from its place some time before the event (D.iii.59f.; MA.ii.885).

Pacetana thought that both wheels were alike, but the wheelwright proved to him that the one he had made hurriedly was faulty in various ways, owing to the crookedness of its parts.

There he fell a victim to ophthalmia and was prescribed for by a doctor; but he neglected his eyes, devoting his whole time to the duties of recluse ship. He became an arahant but lost the sight of his eyes, hence his name. Later, Cakkhupāla’s colleagues returned to Sāvatthi and, at his own request, Cakkhupāla’s brother sent his nephew Pālita, ordained as a monk, to fetch him. On the way through the forest, Pālita was attracted by the song of a woodcutter’s wife and, bidding his uncle wait, went and sinned with her.

'campā':['1. Campā.-A city in India on the river of the same name; it was the capital of Anga and was celebrated for its beautiful lake, the Gaggarā-pokkharanī (q.v.), which was excavated by Queen Gaggarā. On its banks was a grove of campaka-trees, well known for the fragrance of their marvellous white flowers, and there, in the Buddha’s time, wandering teachers were wont to lodge. The Buddha himself stayed thereon several occasions (Vin.i.312; S.i.195; A.iv.59, 168; v.151, 189). Sāriputta (A.iv.59) and Vangīsa (S.i.195) are also said to have stayed there. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.147) mentions Campā as one of the six important cities of India, its foundation being ascribed to Mahāgovinda (D.ii.235). It lay at a distance of sixty yojanas from Mithilā (J.iv.32). In the Buddha’s time the people of Campā owed allegiance to Bimbisāra, as king of Magadha, and Bimbisāra had given a royal fief in Campā to the brahmin Sonadanda (D.i.111). Campā was evidently an important centre of trade, and we are told that merchants travelled from there to Suvannabhūmi for purposes of trade (E.g., J.vi.539). Most probably it was the Indian colonists from Campā who named one of their most important settlements in Indo-China after this famous old town. The ancient name of Campā was probably Mālini or Mālina.( Campasya tu puri Campā, yā Mālinyabhavat purā; Mbh.xii.5, 6, 7; Matsyapurāṇa 48, 97, etc.; Law, A.G.I.6, n.2).<br>The ninth chapter of the Mahā Vagga of the Vinaya Pitaka (Vin.i.312ff; see also Vin.iī.307) contains several important regulations laid down by the Buddha at Campā regarding the validity and otherwise of formal acts of the Sangha.<br>Campā is mentioned as the birthplace of Sona-Kolivisa, Jambugāmika, Nandaka and Bharata, and among those who resided there were Bāhuna, Vajjiyamāhita and Thullanandā and her companions.<br>The Sonadanda, the Dasuttara, the Kandāraka and the Kārandava Suttas were preached there.<br>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.565), Campā was so called because the whole place abounded in large Campaka-trees.<br>Campā is generally identified with a site about twenty-four miles to the east of the modern Bhagalpur, near the villages of Campānagara and Campāpura (C.A.G.I.5). It was visited by Hiouen Thsang (Beal, Records ii.187f), and Fa Hien calls it a great kingdom with many places of worship (p.65).<br>The Buddha’s bathing-robe was enshrined in Campā (Bu.xxviii.9).

'campeyya jātaka':['Once the king of Magadha, at constant war with the king ofAnga, obtaining the help of the Nāga-king who dwelt in the river Campā, defeated his rival. Thereafter he held an annual festival in honour of the Nāga-king. The Bodhisatta, a very poor man, saw Campeyya’s splendour on his way to the feast and longed for a like greatness. As a result, after death, he was born in the Nāga world where he became king under the name of Campeyya. Realising what had happened, he felt disgust at his position as a Nāga and made many attempts to observe religious vows, hoping, in this way, to gain release. But he was foiled in his efforts by his consort Sumanā. At last he came to the world of men, where he kept fast on certain days, lying on an ant-hill. There he was taken captive by a snake charmer who tortured him in various ways and took him about, exhibiting him for gain. By certain tokens of which Campeyya had earlier warned her, Sumanā knew that her husband had been taken captive and, after much searching, she discovered him just as the snake charmer was about to give a performance before Uggasena, king of Benares. The whole story was then revealed, and the snake charmer set Campeyya free. That Uggasena might be convinced of the truth of the story, he was invited to the Nāga-world, where he and his retinue were lavishly entertained.<br>The story was related in connection with the observance of uposatha vows. Devadatta was the snake charmer and Sāriputta was Uggasena. Rāhulamātā was Sumanā (J.iv.454-68).<br>The Campeyya-cariyā is included in the Cariyāpitaka (p.85f ) in order to illustrate sīla-pāramitā.<br>This Jātaka is often referred to (E.g., J.i.45; MA.ii.617) as one of the births in which the Bodhisatta practised sīla to perfection.'],

The Elder had very weak eyes, but when the king touched his feet as would a snake, he remained unafraid and asked who was there. The story is related to show that arahants know no fear.

'candana':['1. Candana.-A deva, vassal of the Four Regent Gods (D.ii.258). He is mentioned as one of the chief Yakkhas to be invoked by followers of the Buddha in case of need (D.iii.204). He once visited Lomasakangiya at the Nigrodhārāma, questioned him regarding the True Saint, and recited to him stanzas learnt when the Buddha preached the Bhaddekaratta Sutta in Tāvatimsa (M.iii.199f) (but see below). The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.53) records a conversation between Candana and the Buddha and a visit paid by Candana to Mahā Moggallāna (S.iv.280).<br>Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.951) says he was an upāsaka in the time of Kassapa Buddha and offered the four requisites to the Buddha and the monks, as a result of which he became a deva. It is elsewhere stated that in Kassapa’s time Candana and Lomasakangiya were friends and that both became monks. (ThagA.i.84f. In this version not Candana, but Lomasakangiya, expounds the Sutta; in M.iii.199f.it is Candana).<br>When Kassapa preached the Bhaddekaratta Sutta, Candana asked Lomasakangiya to explain it; this he was unable to do, and so made a wish that he should be able to explain it in a future birth, Candana wishing that he should then ask the questions again. Both wishes were fulfilled. For details see Lomasakangiya (2).<br>2. Candana Thera.-He belonged to a rich family in Sāvatthi, and having heard the Buddha preach, became a sotāpanna. When a son was born to him he joined the Order and took to meditating in the forest. Later he dwelt in a charnel-field near Sāvatthi. There he was visited by his wife and child who hoped to win him back, but, seeing them from afar, he made a special effort and became an arahant, preaching to his wife as she approached (Thag.vs.299-302; ThagA.i.395f).<br>Thirty-one kappas ago he was a tree-sprite, and having seen the Pacceka Buddha Sudassana, gave him a kutaja-flower. He is probably identical with Kutajapupphiya Thera of the Apaddna. (ii.451; the same verses are also ascribed to Hārita).<br>3.

As a result of this act, the rice-pot in her home never became empty, however many people she might feed. In previous existences she had entertained the monks of various Buddhas, taking a rice-pot in one band and a spoon in the other. Therefore, in her left hand was the sign of the lotus, covering the palm, and in her right the sign of the moon. Further, by reason of her having fetched and filtered water for the monks, on the sole of her left foot was marked a lotus and on the right a moon; hence her name, Candapadumā. When the Buddha visited Mendaka’s house and, after the meal, preached to the household, Candapadumā became asotāpanna (DhA.iii.363-86). She was one of the five persons of great merit (Mahāpuññā) (AA.i.219; PsA.509). The Visuddhimagga (ii.383) calls her Candapadumasirī.<br>2.

'candābha':['1. Candābha Thera.-An arahant. He belonged to a wealthy brahmin family of Rājagaha and was called Candābha because from the circle of his navel proceeded a light resembling that of the moon’s disk. When he grew up, the brahmins seated him in a carriage and took him about, proclaiming that whoever stroked his body would receive power and glory. By this means they earned much money. One day, in Sāvatthi, a dispute arose between the brahmins and the Buddha’s followers as to Candābha’s supernatural powers, and finally they took him to the Buddha for him to settle the quarrel. As Candābha approached the Buddha, the light from his body disappeared and Candābha, thinking that this was owing to some charm, asked to be taught the same. The Buddha stipulated that he should join the Order. Having done so, Candābha was asked to meditate on the thirty-two constituent parts of the Body. Soon afterwards he became an arahant.<br>In a previous birth he was a forester and formed a friendship with a merchant to whom he supplied red sandalwood. One day, when he visited the merchant in the town, he was taken by him to the place where a shrine was being erected over the remains of Kassapa Buddha. The forester, making a moon-disk from sandalwood, placed it within the shrine. After death, for a whole Buddha-interval, he was in Tāvatimsa and was known as the deva Candābha. DhA.iv.187ff; the SNA. version (ii.523ff) differs from this in several details.<br>2. Candābha.

'candāla sutta':['He who is without faith, without morals, is a diviner by curious ceremonies, believes in luck and not deeds, who seeks outside the Order for persons worthy of gifts - such a man is a candāla among laymen. The person possessing the opposite qualities is like a lotus. A.iii.206.'],
'candālatissa':['According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.52), there was once a period of great disaster in Ceylon, known as the Canndāla-tissabhaya. There was no food to be had, and Sakka provided the monks with a raft on which to cross the sea. Sixty monks, however, remained in Ceylon, guarding the scriptures. Twelve years later, when the danger was past, the monks who had left the land returned and dwelt in the Mandalārāma in Kallagāma (Kālakagāma?). There the two parties of monks met and, on comparing their records of the scriptures, these were found not to differ by so much as a syllable or even a single letter.<br>Comparison of this story with the account given elsewhere (E.g., VibhA.445ff) of the Brāhmanatissacorabhaya strongly suggests that both refer to the same account.

'candimā':['1. Candimā, Candimasa, Canda.-The name of the devaputta whose abode (vimāna) is the moon (Canda), sometimes also called Candima.

There are other devas besides Canda who dwell in the moon (D.ii.269).<br>According to the Bilārikosiya Jātaka (J.iv.63, 69), Sāriputta, having once given alms, was born as Canda, while in the Sudhābhojana Jātaka (J.v.382, 412) it is Moggallāna who was so born. The moon cannot move in the sky without the permission of Candimā, and he can stop its movement at will (E.g., DhA.ii.143, 146; iii.97).<br>It is said that once, when Candimā was seized by Rāhu Asurinda, he invoked the Buddha in a verse and the Buddha asked Rāhu to set him at liberty, which request was granted (S.i.50). The deva Candimasa who is mentioned (S.i.51) as visiting the Buddha is probably identical with Candimā. The moon was worshipped when children were desired (E.g., J.iv.1).<br>The Sasa Jātaka (No.513) gives details of the story of how, as a result of the Bodhisatta’s sacrifice when born as a hare, Sakka painted the figure of a hare on the moon, which sign will be seen throughout this kappa (J.i.172).<br>2.

The Buddha declares that the brahmin pretensions to possess the sole truth are vain, and goes on to explain how a man can come to have faith in truth, then gain enlightenment with regard to it, and finally attain the truth itself by means of practice and development.

'cālikā':['A village near the Cālikapabbata, where the Buddha spent the vassas of the thirteenth, eighteenth and nineteenth years after the Enlightenment (BuA.3).<br>His attendant on one of these visits was Meghiya. Close to Cālikā was the village of Jantu where Meghiya went for alms. In the neighbourhood was the river Kimikālā, on whose banks was a mango grove (A.iv.354; Ud.iv.1; DhA.i.287f).<br>Outside the city gate and all around the city was a bog (cala-panka), owing to which the city gave the impression of moving, hence the name (UdA.217; AA.ii.793). v.l.

'cānakka':['A brahmin of Takkasilā, who killed King Dhanananda and placed Candagutta on the throne (Mhv.v.16f.; Mbv.98). In his youth Cānakka looked after his mother, and finding that she was worrying lest he, who was destined for kingly power, should leave her, he broke his tooth, having been told that there his luck resided. One day, on going for alms to Dhanananda’s palace, he was insulted, and in order to avenge the insult he kidnapped the king’s son, Pabbatakumāra. He then adopted Candagutta and, finding him better fitted for kingship than Pabbata, he contrived that the latter should be killed. When preparations had been made, he induced Candagutta to rise in revolt against Dhanananda, and, finally, to kill him and ascend the throne. (See MT.181ff for details, also Candagutta).<br>The Theragāthā Commentary (i.440) states that Tekicchāni’s father, Subandhu, roused the jealousy of Cānakka, who had him put in prison.'],

'cātumāsika':['1. Cātumāsika-Brahmadatta.-A king of Benares. Going to his park in the early summer, he rested under a kovilāra-tree which was thickly covered with leaves. Going again in midsummer, he found it full of blossom.

'cātummahārājikā':['The inhabitants of the lowest (Cātummahārājika) deva world.<br>This world derives its name from the Four Great Kings (Cattāro Mahārājāno) who dwell there as guardians of the four quarters;<br>Dhatarattha of the East, Virūlhaka of the South, Virūpakkha of the West, and Vessarāna of the North (D.ii.207f; iii.194f). They keep large retinues consisting, respectively, of Gandhabbas, Kumbhaṇḍas, Nāgas and Yakkhas, all of whom dwell in the same world as their lords and accompany them on their travels. These kings are mentioned (D.ii.257f) as having undertaken the protection of the Buddha from the moment of his conception in his mother’s womb, and in the ātānātiya Sutta, they appear as protectors not only of the Buddha but also of his followers (See, e.g., DhA.ii.146; iii.96).<br>The Four Kings appear to have been regarded as Recorders of the happenings in the assemblies of the devas (D.ii.225). On the eighth day of the lunar half-month, they send their councillors out into the world to discover if men cultivate righteousness and virtue; on the fourteenth day they send their sons, on the fifteenth day they themselves appear in the world, all these visits having the same purpose. Then, at the assembly of the devas, they submit their report to the gods of Tāvatimsa, who rejoice or lament according as to whether men prosper in righteousness or not (A.i.142f.; for more details see AA.i.376f).<br>These four Gods surpass the other inhabitants of their worlds in ten ways - beauty, length of life, etc. - because their merit is greater than that of the others (A.iv.242).<br>Besides these Regent Gods and their followers, other dwellers are to be found in their world - the Khiddāpadosikā, the Manopadosikā, the Sitavalāhakā, the Unhavalāhakā, and the devaputtas Candima and Suriya (VibhA.519; MNidA.108).<br>Life in the Cātummahārājikā world lasts, according to human computation, ninety thousand years (DA.ii.472, 647, but see Kvu.207). Beings are born there as a result of various acts of piety and faith which, however, are based on motives not very exalted (A.iv.60).<br>The Cātummahārājikā world is situated half-way up Mount Sineru. Some of the devas of the world dwell in the mountain, others in the sky. (On these gods see Moulton: Zoroastrianism 22-7, 242.)'],

'cetanā sutta':['1. Cetanā Sutta.-That which we will and intend to do and with which we are occupied, that becomes an object (ārammana) for the persistence of consciousness (viññāna).

'cetiya':['Contains the story of Apacara, king ofCeti, and the world’s first liar.<br>It was related in reference to the swallowing up ofDevadatta by the earth.<br>J.iii.454ff<br>cetiya<br>1. Ceti, Cetiya.-One of the sixteen Mahājanapadas (A.i.213, etc.), probably identical with Cedi of the older documents (E.g., Rv.viii.5, 37-9). The people of Ceti seem to have had two distinct settlements: one, perhaps the older, was in the mountains, probably the present Nepal (Bud. India, p.26). It is evidently this older settlement which is mentioned in the Vessantara Jātaka; it was passed by Vessantara on his way into exile in the Himalayas, and was thirty yojanas distant from Jetuttara (J.vi.514, 518). The other, probably a later colony, lay near the Yamunā, to the east, in the neighbourhood of and contiguous to the settlement of the Kurus; for we are told (Vin.iv.108f; J.i.360f) that the Buddha, having dwelt in the Ceti country, went to Bhaddavatikā, where, at the Ambatittha, Sāgata tamed a Nāga, and from there he went to Kosambī. This part of the country corresponds roughly to the modern Bundelkhand and the adjoining region (Law: Geog. of Early Bsm., p.16).<br>It was probably of the older Ceti that Sotthivatī was the capital, where once reigned Apacara, who uttered the first lie in the world. (J.iii.454ff Sotthivati is probably identical with Suktimati or Sukti-Sāhvaya of the Mahābhārata (iii.20, 50; xiv.83, 2); see also PHAI.81).<br>The journey from Benares to Ceti lay through a forest which was infested by robbers (J.i.253, 256). The settlement of Ceti was an important centre of Buddhism, even in the time of the Buddha. The Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.355f; v.41f; 157ff) mentions several discourses preached to the Cetis, while the Buddha dwelt in their town of Sahajāti. While dwelling in the Pācīnavamsadāya in the Ceti country, Anuruddha became an arahant after a visit which the Buddha paid to him (A.iv.228; see also Vin.i.300f). The Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.200 and passim) leads us to infer that the Buddha visited the Ceti country several times. The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.436f) records a discussion on the four Ariyan Truths among a number of monks, including Gavampati, dwelling at Sahajāti (v.l. Sahañcanika).<br>It is said (E.g., AA.ii.765) that the country was called Ceti because it was ruled by kings bearing the name of Ceti or Cetiya (SNA.i.135).<br>2. Cetiya.-A mythical king (Mhv.ii.3; Dpv.iii.5; Mtu.i.348). See Ceti (1).<br>Apacara is also referred to as Cetiya (J.iii.457, 460, etc.), shortened into Cecca (J.v.267).'],
'cetiya sutta':['The Buddha goes with Ananda on his begging round in Vesāli and, after the meal, rests at the Cāpāla Cetiya.

When Ananda leaves him, Māra asks that the Buddha should die, as his disciples have been fully trained. The Buddha agrees, and declares that he will die in three months time. S.v.258ff; the incident is also given in D.ii.102ff and Ud.vi.1.'],
'cetiyapabbata':['Also called Cetiyagiri. The later name of the Missaka mountain given on account of its many shrines. Devānampiyatissa built a vihāra there - the second vihāra in Ceylon - for Mahinda and those ordained under him (Mhv.xvi.12-17). The relics, obtained by Sumanasāmanera from Asoka and from Sakka, were deposited there until they were needed. According to the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xxii.23ff) this fact was the occasion for the name. One of the eight saplings of the Sacred Bodhi-tree at Anurādhapura was planted in the drama on Cetiyagiri (Mhv.xix.62). Mahinda spent the last years of his life on Cetiyagiri and died there, and there his relics were enshrined (Mhv.xx.32, 45). Near the mountain was the village of Dvāramandala (Mhv.xxiii.23). Kutakannatissa built an uposatha-hall on the mountain and planted a Bodhi-tree, while Bhāti-kābhaya supplied food daily to one thousand monks dwelling there (Mhv.xxxiv.30f, 64), and Lañjakatissa had the vihāra paved at a cost of one hundred thousand (Mhv.xxxiii.25). Mahādāṭhikamahānāga made four gateways and a road round the mountain, and held the Giribhaṇḍapūjā with great pomp and ceremony; it is said that in order that the people might approach the mountain with clean feet he spread carpets right up to it from the Kadamba River (Mhv.xxxiv.75ff). Kanirajānutissa had sixty monks of Cetiyapabbata put to death as traitors by flinging them into the cave called Kanira (Mhv.xxxv.11). Vasabha provided four thousand lamps to be lighted on Cetiyagiri (Mhv.xxxv.80), while Jetthatissa gave to the vihāra the income derived from the Kālamattika Tank. (Mhv.xxxvi.130; see also Dpv.xv.69; xvii.90; xix.13, and Sp.i.82ff).<br>In the time of Kakusandha, Cetiyagiri was known as Devakūta, in that of Konāgamana as Suvannakūta, and in that of Kassapa as Subhakūta (Sp.i.86f). The Dhammarucikas once occupied the Ambatthalavihāra on Cetiyapabbata, it having been given to them by Dhātusena (Cv.xxxviii.75). Aggabodhi supplied a permanent supply of water for the bathing-tank called Nāgasondi, on the top of Cetiyagiri (Cv.xlii.28; see Cv. Trs.i.68, n.8), while Aggabodhi III. gave to the vihāra the village of Ambillapadara (Cv.xliv.122). Aggabodhi V. restored the ruined buildings of Cetiyapabbata at a cost of one hundred and twenty thousand pieces (Cv.xlviii.7), while the queen of Udaya I, built there the Kanthakacetiya, and her husband decorated the mountain with brightly coloured flags and streamers (Cv.xlix.23, 27). Sena I, gave to the monastery the income from the Kānavāpi (Cv.l.72), and Sena II. Provided a hospital for the use of the monks there (Cv.li.73). Kassapa VI. built the Hadayunha Parivena and gifted it to the Dhammarucikas (Cv.lii.18). Parakkamabāhu I restored all the old buildings which had been destroyed and built sixty-four thūpas (Cv.lxxviii.108).<br>The Commentaries relate several anecdotes connected with Cetiyapabbata. Maliyadeva Thera recited there the Chachakka Sutta, and sixty listening bhikkhus became arahants (MA.ii.1064). Lomasanāga Theca lived in the Padhānaghara in the Piyanguguhā there and overcame the cold he felt by meditating on the Lokantarikaniraya (MA.i.65). Cetiyapabbata was the residence of Kālabuddharakkhita, and King Saddhātissa spent some time there (MA.i.469f. See also Vsm.20, 64; DhSA.194, 200; AA.i.44). At the time that Fa Hsien came to Ceylon there were two thousand monks in Cetiyagiri, including a monk of great fame, called Dharmagupta (Giles: p.72).'],

'chaddanta':['1. Chaddanta.-A forest in Himavā. In the forest was the Mandākinī Lake, on the banks of whichAññā-Kondañña lived in retirement for twelve years, waited upon by eight thousand elephants who had once ministered to Pacceka Buddhas. SA.i.217; ThagA.ii.3, 7; AA.i.84.<br>2. Chaddanta.-A lake, one of the seven great lakes of the Himālaya region (A.iv.101; AA.ii.759). It was fifty leagues long and fifty broad. In the middle of the lake, for a space of twelve leagues, the water was like a jewel and no weeds grew there. Around this space were seven girdles of lilies, each girdle of a different hue and each a league in extent. Round the lake were seven ranges of mountains - Cullakāla, Mahākāla, Udaka, Candapassa, Suriyapassa, Manipassa and Suvannapassa, the last range being seven leagues in height and of a golden hue on the side overlooking the lake. On the west side of the lake was the Kañcanaguhā, twelve leagues in extent, where the elephant-king lived. J.v.37.<br>3. Chaddanta.-A tribe of elephants, of which tribe the Bodhisatta was once born as king (see No.4). The Chaddantas and the Uposathas are the two highest classes of elephant (DhA.iii.248). The Chaddantakula sometimes provides the hatthiratana for a Cakkavatti, in which case it is the youngest of the tribe who so functions (KhpA.172). Of the ten tribes of elephants enumerated in the books (E.g., UdA.403; VibhA.397) the Chaddanta is classed as the highest, and the Buddha possesses the strength of ten Chaddanta-elephants, each elephant having the strength of ten thousand million men (BuA.37). These elephants have the power of travelling through the air and are white in hue (J.v.37; Vsm.650).<br>4. Chaddanta.-The Bodhisatta, born as king of the elephants of the Chaddanta tribe, eight thousand in number. His body was pure white, with red face and feet, and seven parts of his body touched the ground. He lived in the Kañcanaguhā on the banks of the Chaddanta Lake, his chief queens being Cūlasubhaddā and Mahāsubhaddā. Owing to the preference shown to Mahāsubhaddā by Chaddanta, Cūlasubhaddā conceived a grudge against him, and one day, when Chaddanta was entertaining five hundred Pacceka Buddhas, she offered them wild fruits and made a certain wish. As a result she was reborn in the Madda king’s family and was named Subhaddā. Later she became chief consort of the king of Benares. Remembering her ancient grudge, she schemed to have Chaddanta’s tusks cut off. All the hunters were summoned by the king, and Sonuttara was chosen for the task. It took him seven years, seven months and seven days to reach Chaddanta’s dwelling-place. He dug a pit and covered it, and as the elephant passed over it shot at him a poisoned arrow. When Chaddanta realised what had happened, he charged Sonuttara, but, seeing that he was clad in a yellow robe, he restrained himself. Having learnt Sonuttara’s story, he showed him how his tusks could be cut off, but Sonuttara’s strength was not sufficient to saw them through. Chaddanta thereupon took the saw with his own trunk and, wounded as he was and suffering excruciating pain from the incisions already made in his jaws, he sawed through the tusks, handed them over to the hunter and died. In seven days, through the magic power of the elephant’s tusks, Sonuttara returned to Benares; but when Subhaddā heard that her conspiracy had resulted in the death of her former lover and husband, she died of a broken heart (J.v.36ff).<br>Chaddanta is mentioned as one of the births in which the Bodhisatta practised sīla-pāramitā (J.i.45). Chaddanta could find delight only in the lakes and forests of the Himālaya, not in the crowded city (Vsm.650).<br>See also Chaddanta Jātaka.'],
'chaddanta jātaka':['The story of the Bodhisatta, born as Chaddanta, king of elephants.<br>It was related in reference to a nun of Sāvatthi who, while listening one day to a sermon by the Buddha, admired his extreme beauty of form and wondered if she had ever been his wife.

Thereupon Pasenadi asked him to act as instructor in the Dhamma to the women of the palace, but he refused the invitation, deeming that such a course would be unseemly and unwise. The task was therefore given to Ananda. DhA.i.380f; cp. Vin.iv.157. The story is also found in J.i.381f, with several variations in detail.

Having failed to tempt the Bodhisatta, she spoke calumny against him and had him put in prison. But he explained the matter to the king and was released. From that time the king gave up envy. In another birth he was a king ofBenares, strongly addicted to drinking and meat-eating; one day the meat prepared for him was eaten by the palace dogs. It was fast-day, and as there was no meat in the town the cook sought the queen’s advice. When the king sat down to eat, his small son, whom he much loved, was brought to him in the hope that he might forget to ask for meat. But the plan failed, and in his drunkenness he twisted his son’s neck and had his flesh cooked for him to eat.

The Bodhisatta climbed down from the tree and pointed out to them their error. The king, being very pleased, made him ruler of the city by night and placed round his neck the garland of red flowers which he himself was wearing.

She let herself be seen going towards the vihāra in the evening, spent the night in the heretics’ quarters near by, and in the morning men saw her returning from the direction of the vihāra. When questioned, she said that she had passed the night with the Buddha. After some months she simulated pregnancy by tying a disc of wood round her body and appearing thus before the Buddha, as he preached to a vast congregation, she charged him with irresponsibility and callousness in that he made no provision for her confinement. The Buddha remained silent, but Sakka’s throne was heated and he caused a mouse to sever the cords of the wooden disc, which fell to the ground, cutting Ciñcā’s toes. She was chased out of the vihāra by those present, and as she stepped outside the gate the fires of the lowest hell swallowed her up (DhA.iii.178f; J.iv.187f; ItA.69).<br>In a previous birth, too, she had helped in various ways to harm the Bodhisatta.

Citta became very proficient, and was sent one day, in place of his teacher, to the house of a villager who had invited the teacher and his pupils. But while there, in a moment of forgetfulness, the brothers used the Candāla dialect, and having thus disclosed their caste, were driven out of Takkāsilā.<br>In their next birth they became does and in a subsequent birth ospreys. They were always together and always met their death together. Later Citta was born as the son of the chaplain of Kosambī, and Sambhūta as son of the king ofUttarapañcāla. Citta, becoming an ascetic at the age of sixteen, remembered his past births. He waited till Sambhūta had reigned for fifty years, and knowing that he also had some recollection of his previous existences, taught a stanza to a lad and sent him to recite it before the king.

Three times the king sent for him, but he refused to go until the king decreed that no infant in the country should suck milk until the Elder should visit the palace. He dwelt in the palace for seven days and always pronounced the same blessing, no matter who saluted him: ”May the king be happy.” On the Elder’s return to the cave, the deity in the ironwood tree outside stood holding a torch and the Elder attained arahantship (Vsm.38). It may be the same Elder who is mentioned elsewhere (Vsm.171) as having developed tejo-kasina on regarding the flame of a lamp on his return to the vihāra after listening to the Dhamma, and again pīta-kasina when he saw on Cittalapabbata a seat spread with pattaṅga-flowers (Vsm.173).<br>3.

Sometimes it happens that those who are engaged in the Dhamma praise their fellows, and similarly with those devoted to jhāna. None of these things are profitable. Dhamma-zealots should learn to praise those eager for jhāna and vice versa (A.iii.355f).<br>3. Cunda Sutta.-Mahā Cunda tells the monks at Sahajātī how it is possible to distinguish true statements from false when made by a monk about himself and his attainments (A.v.41ff).<br>4. Cunda Sutta.-Cunda Samanuddesa comes to Jetavana from Nālagāmaka, where he had attended Sāriputta during his last illness, and reports his death to Ananda, producing, at the same time, Sāriputta’s bowl and outer robe and the water-strainer containing his relies. Ananda accompanies Cunda to the Buddha, where he breaks the news. The Buddha praises Sāriputta’s attainments and takes the opportunity of emphasising the impermanence of all things. S.v.161ff'],
'cunda sūkarika':['A pork butcher near Veluvana.<br>For forty-five years he plied his trade, killing pigs in such a way as to retain the flavour of the flesh unimpaired. When death approached he saw before him the fires of Avīci and roared with pain. For seven days he grunted like a pig, crawling on all fours, and no one could prevent him. The monks told the Buddha of the noises they had heard when passing the butcher’s house, and the Buddha explained how retribution had fallen on Cunda commensurate with his wickedness. DhA.i.105ff'],

'cundatthīla':['A village near Benares, but on the other side of the river and between Vasabhagāma and Benares (v.l. Cundavīla).<br>Pv.iii.1; PvA.168, 170; Mtu.iii.325, 327.'],
'cundī':['Cundī.-A princess. She visited the Buddha at the Kalandakanivāpa in Veluvana, and he preached to her the Cundī Sutta (A.iii.35f). According to the Commentary (AA.ii.596), she was the daughter of Bimbisāra. The king gave her five hundred chariots for the use of herself and her companions. She was one of the three women who received this gift from their fathers, the others being Visākhā and the princess Sumanā. Cundī’s brother was Cunda. Her name occurs in a list of eminent upāsikās. A.iv.347.<br>Cundī Sutta.-Cundī visits the Buddha and tells him that, according to her brother, Cunda, those who take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Order and refrain from the taking of life, from theft, carnal lusts, lying and liquor, will be born in a happy condition after death. She wishes to know more of this. The Buddha explains to her that the Tathāgata is the best of beings, the Doctrine which leads to Nibbāna is the best of teachings, the Tathāgata’s Order is the best field of merit, and of virtues, those beloved by Ariyans are the best. A.iii.35f.'],
'cūla':['An Elder of Ceylon. He once went to Jambudīpa, embarking at Mahātittha in a boat, in which he dwelt in seclusion. On the way across, while looking at the ocean, he developed āpokasina (Vsm.170).<br>Another thera of the same name is mentioned in the Commentaries and is described as a Samyuttabhānaka. It is said that because he dwelt in mettā poison had no effect on him (Vsm.313; AA.i.865). He probably lived in the time of the Brāhmanatissabhaya (q.v.). His colleagues were Isidatta and Mahāsona. During the time of the peril, he took leave of his colleagues and went to worship at the Mahāvihāra. He found it empty and started for the south, when the sprite of a neighbouring tree, assuming human form, looked after him and escorted him to a village near the Jajjaranadī, where he was supported by foresters (?pannakhādakamanussā) till the peril was past (VibhA.446). The Digha Commentary (DA.iii.883) mentions another Cūla-Sīva and calls him Tilokanagaravāsi (v.l. Lokuttaravāsī). He was evidently a well-known commentator.<br>cūla<br>Followers of the Buddha excel those of other teachers in faith in their teacher, faith in his Doctrine, strict observance of the sīlas and in love towards their fellow-believers, laymen and monks.<br>Their goal is the goal of men without cravings, without attachments, without facetiousness, without combative spirit, without obsessions. Their Doctrine is perfect, rightly revealed, rightly preached. M.i.63ff.<br>cūla<br>The Buddha visits Sakuladāyi at the Moranivāpa near Rājagaha and their talk turns on perfection. The Buddha points out that Sakuladāyi’s conception of perfection is vague and undefined, and proves, on examination, empty and faulty. In answer to Sakuladāyi’s question as to what the Buddha would define as absolute bliss, the Buddha explains the four Jhānas and the destruction of the āsavas. Sakuladāyi is converted (M.ii.29ff). The sutta also contains references to the teachings of Nigantha Nātaputta.<br>cūla<br>Saccaka Niganthīputta goes about Vesāli saying that he is unable to find his match in discussion. He meets Assaji and, after a preliminary debate with him, goes with a large company of Licchavis to seek the Buddha in theMahāvana. He questions the Buddha on his method of training, and the Buddha explains this to him. The talk then turns on Self, and the Buddha points out the emptiness of Saccaka’s contentions. Saccaka (here referred to as Aggivessana) refuses to acknowledge defeat until the YakkhaVajirapāni threatens to smite him. Saccaka is driven to yield point after point till the sweat streams from his brow, and the Buddha shows the assembled multitude how his own skin remains quite dry. In the end, Saccaka invites the Buddha and his disciples to a meal on the next day. M.i.227ff<br>cūla<br>The Buddha realises that Rāhula is possessed of the qualities necessary to Deliverance and goes with him to Andhavana for the siesta. There the Buddha demonstrates, by means of question and answer, that all things are impermanent, and impresses on Rāhula the manner in which the disciples of the Ariyans should strive to be delivered from them. Rāhula takes the lesson to heart, and even as it is being delivered attains to arahantship. (M.iii.277f; this sutta is also found at S.iv.105ff, where it is called the Rāhula Sutta).<br>Many thousands of devas are present at the preaching of the sermon, and this sutta is therefore given as an illustration of the Buddha’s great compassion (E.g., UdA.324; MA.i320; also Mil.20). Among the suttas specially preached to Rāhula, this one emphasises vipassanā (AA.ii.547). It may have been the incidents mentioned in this sutta that were illustrated in the relic-chamber of the Mahā Thūpa. See Mhv.xxx.83.<br>cūla<br>The Elder Mālunkyaputta is dissatisfied, feeling that the Buddha has not expounded to him various speculations concerning life and death and the nature of the world. He visits the Buddha at Jetavana and tells him of his disappointment. The Buddha points out to him that no promise was made regarding the elucidation of such problems and tells him it were fitter if he were to speculate by striving for deliverance. Mālunkyaputta sees the error of his ways. M.i.426ff<br>cūla<br>Subha Todeyyaputta visits the Buddha at Jetavana and asks him why, among mankind, some are high and some low, some long-lived and some short, some handsome and some plain, some rich and some poor, etc. It is the result of their heritage from the past, answers the Buddha; their deeds are their possessions, their parents, their kindred and their refuge; he then proceeds to explain in detail (M.iii.202ff). Subha acknowledges the Buddha as his teacher.<br>The Commentary (MA.ii.962) calls this the Subha Sutta. For details of the circumstances in which the sutta was preached see Subha Todeyyaputta.<br>cūla<br>1. Cūla-Kāla.-The youngest of three brothers, named Kāla, house-holders of Setavyā. He accompanied Mahā-Kāla to Sāvatthi with a caravan, and when Mahā-Kāla entered the Order he joined him. Later, as they were returning to Setavyā, this time with the Buddha and the monks, he was sent on ahead to arrange seats in his former house, whither the Buddha and the monks had been invited. His two erstwhile wives mocked at him and persuaded him to return to the lay-life. DhA.i.55ff<br>2. Cūla-Kāla.-A previous birth of Aññā-Kondañña. He was a house-holder of Hamsavatī, in the time of Vipassī Buddha. One day going to the rice-field, he hulled a kernel of rice, ate it and found it unusually sweet. He thereupon obtained his share of the field from his brother Mahā-Kāla, and gave to the Buddha and the monks the first-fruits of a single crop, nine times, at nine different stages (DhA.i.82). He thus became the first to gain any attainment when Gotama Buddha preached his first sermon (DhA.i.8ff).<br>3. Cūla-Kāla.-A lay disciple of the Buddha. He was once on his way back to Sāvatthi, having spent the night in listening to the Doctrine, when thieves, fleeing from their pursuers, threw their stolen goods in front of him and disappeared. When he was charged with theft, some women water-carriers, who had witnessed the incident on their way to the watering place, obtained his release. DhA.iii.157.<br>cūla<br>A brahmin of Kosambī. Having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order. At that time the Kosambī monks had become contentious, but Gavaccha remained steadfast and attained to arahantship.<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a labourer and, finding the monk Sujāta looking for pieces of stuff for a robe, gave him his garment.<br>As a result, he was king of the devas thirty-three times and king of men seven times (Thag.11; ThagA.i.55f). He is, perhaps, identical with Upaddhadussadāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.435f; but the same verses are, in ThagA. (i.266) also attributed to Heraññakāni.<br>cūla<br>Preached at Assapura to the assembled monks.<br>It is not the robe that makes the recluse, nor living under a tree, nor in-toning texts, bathing three times a day, etc.<br>It is by putting away all the evil qualities that a man becomes a true Bhikkhu.

'cūla dhammasamādāna sutta':['Preached to the monks assembled at Jetavana. There are four ways of professing a Doctrine - one temporarily pleasant but ripening to pain thereafter; another temporarily unpleasant but ripening to pleasure, etc. -<br>The sutta also describes the monks and recluses who follow these different ways. M.i.305ff'],
'cūla dukkhakkhandha sutta':['Mahānāma, the Sākiyan, visits the Buddha at Nigrodhārāma and asks him why it is that evil states of mind arise in one. The Buddha replies that it is because of certain undiscarded states of consciousness, which can be got rid of through reṇunciation.<br>He proceeds to describe how he, too, failed to find satisfaction before his Enlightenment. He then tells of a conversation he once had on Gijjhakūta with some Niganthas, who believed that suffering could be got rid of through austerities and how he told them of his happiness which was far greater even than that of Bimbisāra, king of Magadha. M.i.91ff'],
'cūla gopālaka sutta':['Preached to the monks assembled at Ukkācelā. Those who will listen to and trust in the wrong kind of recluse and brahmin and who do not understand good and evil will come to grief, whereas those who hearken to teachers of the right kind will gain deliverance.<br>The theme is illustrated by various similes drawn from the picture of a herdsman driving cattle across a ford.

'cūla gosinga sutta':['The Buddha, residing at the Giñjakāvasatha in Nādikā, visits the Gosinga-Sālavana, where dwell Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila. (According to the Vinaya account (i.350), this incident takes place in Pācīnavamsadāya). At first the keeper tries to stop the Buddha from approaching them, fearing lest he should disturb their meditation. The Buddha questions them as to their attainments and praises them. At the end of the sutta mention is made of a Yakkha, named Dīgha, visiting the Buddha and telling him how the fame of the three Elders had travelled even to the world of Brahmā (M.i.205-11). The sutta illustrates the greatness of harmony (sāmaggi). MA.i.361.'],

The Buddha tells him it would be a mistake to conclude at once from seeing a broad footprint that it belonged to a very large elephant; there are many other possibilities which should first be eliminated. He then proceeds to describe the life of a real recluse, the disciple of the Noble One, and the attainments he reaches; these he calls the Truth-finder’s foot prints. Following this, the disciple makes further discoveries, till his mind is completely free from the āsavas, and then he realises the Truth-finder’s real quest. Jānussoni becomes a follower of the Buddha (M.i.175ff).<br>This was the first sutta preached in Ceylon by Mahinda to Devānampiyatissa. At the end of the discourse the king accepts the Three Refuges.

'cūḷanāga':['1. Cūlanāga Thera.-Generally referred to as Tipitaka-Cūlanāga. He was evidently a very famous commentator, and his opinions are quoted in the commentaries of Buddhaghosa. (E.g., MA.i.126; SA.iii.206; DhsA.229, 267, 284; Vm.389; also FsA.405). Cūlanāga was the pupil of Summa Thera of Dīpavihāra (AA.ii.845) and a contemporary of Tipitaka-Cūlabhaya Thera, who seems to have differed from him most violently on certain points (See VihhA.16; also DhsA.230). Cūlanāga lived in the reign of Kutakanna-Tissa (16-38 A.C.), and we are told (VibhA.452) that the king held him in great respect. Once the Elder had a boil on his finger, and the king, visiting him, put the finger in his mouth to alleviate the pain. The boil burst and the king swallowed the pus therefrom. When the Elder lay dying the king carried on his head the pot containing his stools, lamenting, ”The mainstay of the Dhamma is lost.” The Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.201) tells of an incident which occurred when Cūlanāga was preaching in the Lohapāsāda. A brahmin, listening to him, was so convinced by the sermon of the impermanence of all things, that he ran home and clasped his son to his heart, saying that he was undone. The Elder once received a bowl which it was not right for him to keep and he gave it to the Sangha (Sp.iii.699). Cūlanāga does not always seem to have agreed with his teacher in his interpretations of various matters (VibhA.342). Once when it was announced to Summa that Cūlanāga had explained the word thūpīkata in a certain way, he expressed great sorrow and resentment and declared that though he had seven times read the Vinaya with Cūlanāga, he had never taught him such an explanation; but Cūlanāga was able to uphold his contention (Sp.iv.892; for another incident see Cūla-Summa). Cūlanāga once preached the Chachakka Sutta in Ambilahāla Vihāra, and on that occasion the audience of men extended to a distance of one gāvuta and that of devas to a distance of a league. At the end of the discourse, one thousand monks became arahants (MA.ii.1025).<br>2. Cūlanāga.-A Thera of Vasālanagara. With his brother Mahānāga, he entered the Order and, for thirty years, lived in Cittalapabbata, where he attained arahantship.

One day, after having obtained alms in Candavankavīthi, he fed a starving bitch. That same evening he got large quantities of ghee and molasses which he gave to his colleagues. For thirty two years he gave alms to thousands of monks from food given to him by the people of Candavankavīthi. Later, he became an arahant. Once, 500 monks on pilgrimage to the Bodhi-tree, took him with them to avert danger. In four months they reached Kottapattana and in seven months the Bodhi-tree, being well entertained everywhere. On the way back Cūlanāga was seized with a colic and died; but before death he advised his colleagues to cremate his body and take his ashes that they might be provided with their wants.

But he was an unbeliever, and whenNiganthas came to his house on invitation, Subhaddā refused to do obeisance to them. For this she was ordered out of the house by her father-in-law; but she convinced her mother-in-law that the reasons for her behaviour were sound, and at the suggestion of the latter she prepared a meal and invited to it the Buddha and the congregation of monks, by throwing into the air from the top storey of the house eight handfuls of jasmine.

In a past life he was the Sumanasetthi, under whom Annabhārā (q.v.) worked. In this age he was born at Munda, near the Viñjhā mountains, as the son of Mahāmuṇḍa. When Anuruddha became an arahant and looked back into his past lives he saw how Sumana had helped him. He therefore visited Mahāmuṇḍa and enjoyed his hospitality during one rainy season. At the end of his stay he obtained Munda’s consent to ordain Cūlasumana, who became an arahant while his head was being shaved. Once, when Anuruddha suffered from indigestion, the novice Sumana, having discovered that the water from Anotatta would cure him, went there and brought the water, in spite of all the efforts of the Nāga-king Pannaka (q.v.) to prevent him. Later, Pannaka, realising the novice’s power, asked his pardon and became his friend and servitor. When Anuruddha went with Sumana to Sāvatthi to visit the Buddha, some of the monks began to play with Sumana, patting his head and tweaking his ears. In order to show them Sumana’s power, Anuruddha asked Ananda to summon all the novices in the monastery and ask them to fetch water from Anotatta that he might wash his feet. Only Sumana, the youngest of them all, was able to do this, and his fame spread beyond all measure (DhA.iv.128ff).'],
'cūlasumma':['An eminent Commentator of Ceylon, teacher of Tipitaka Cūlanāga. The pupil seems to have disagreed with some of the explanations of his teacher - e.g., as to the meaning of ekāyanamagga. Cūlanāga said it referred to pubbabhāgasatipatthānamagga, but Cūlasumma held that it referred to missakamagga. They could come to no decision; but while on his way to the bathing-place, Cūlasumma revolved the problem in his mind, and discovering that his pupil was right announced his mistake when Cūlanāga was preaching on the day of the first quarter. Cūlanāga, realising how even his teacher could go astray on this point, explained it at great length for the benefit of future generations (DA.iii.744f.; MA.i.187). The Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.845) calls him Dīpavihāravāsī, while the Vibhaṅga Commentary (p.489; probably Cūlasumma is here a misreading for Cūlasumana) says that he dwelt in Ninkaponnapadhānaghara in Cittalapabbata. The Samantapāsādikā (iv.892) says that he lived in Rohana.'],
'cūlataṇhāsaṅkhaya sutta':['Sakka visits the Buddha at theMigārāmatupāsāda and asks him how a monk can be delivered by the extirpation of cravings and become foremost among gods and men. The Buddha briefly explains, and Sakka leaves him after expressing his satisfaction.<br>Moggallāna, desiring to know if Sakka has really understood the teaching, visits him and asks him the same question. Sakka evades this question and, accompanied by Vessavana, conducts Moggallāna through his palace, Vejayanta, in order to demonstrate his power. Moggallāna causes the palace to quake and, seeing the agitation of Sakka, again asks him the same question; Sakka gives the Buddha’s explanation, word for word, and Moggallāna is satisfied.

'cūlatissa':['A minister of Dutthagāmaṇī. Once when Kandula was lost, he was sent in search and found him looking after the monks of Mahānijjhara. Tissa gave the monks a drink of kāra-fruit and sugar, and took the animal back to the king. Later, Tissa was born in Ambavitthi and entered the Order. Afterwards, while on a voyage to the Bodhi-tree in Gayā, his ship ran short of water. Tissa let down his bowl into the sea. The water became fresh and sweet, and he shared it with the others.

The second section, beginning with the reign of Vijayabāhu II. and ending with that of Parakkamabāhu of Hatthiselapura (Chaps.80-90), seems to be the work of one author whose identity, however, remains unknown.<br>That part of the chronicle which deals with the period from Parakkamabāhu to A.C.1758, the death of Kittisiri Rājasīha, was compiled by Tibbotuvāve Sumaṅgala Thera, and the last chapter has been continued down to 1815 by Hikkaduve Siri Sumaṅgala.<br>For details see P.L.C.141ff.'],

He is several times quoted in the Commentaries (E.g., VibhA.11, 16; Vsm.69, 394, 397). He had a prodigious memory. Once he shut three of the gates of Anurādhapura, allowing only one door for the use of those leaving the city. As each person went out he asked his name, and each of these names he was able to repeat when the owner returned in the evening to the city (DA.ii.530). He was a contemporary of Cūlanāga (DhsA.230; SA.iii.206), with whom he held discussions. His description (given at the Lohapāsāda) (DA.ii.442) of the details connected with the first words uttered by the Buddha after his birth, and the manner in which he walked, is accepted as authentic. He once went with a company of monks on a pilgrimage to Nāgadīpa. On the way he stayed in a monastery. One of his followers, who lacked self-control, made friends with another of like temperament in the vihāra, and Cūlābhaya, seeing them laugh aloud, pointed out how truly the Buddha had said in the Dhātusamyutta that like joins with like. VibhA.457f.'],

'dabba':['An arahant. He was born atAnupiya in a family of the Mallas (Kusinārā, says the Apadāna). As a child of seven he saw the Buddha who was visiting in the Malla country, and he asked his grandmother (his mother having died at his birth) if he might join the Order under the Buddha. She brought him to the Buddha and the boy became an arahant in the Tonsure-hall. He returned with the Buddha to Rājagaha where, with the Buddha’s sanction, and wishing to be of service to the Order, he took upon himself the task of appointing night’s-lodgings to travelling monks and of directing them to meals. He performed his duties most diligently and with great intelligence, and his fame spread far and wide. Monks coming from afar, wishing to witness his skill, would deliberately arrive late and ask for lodgings in some place remote from Rājagaha; Dabba would ”burst into flame” and walk ahead of them, with his finger burning to light them on the way. It was the sight of Dabba on one of these journeys which led to a slave-woman, Punnā, being visited by the Buddha, resulting in her becoming a Sotāpanna (DhA.iii.321ff).<br>It once happened that meals were allotted by Dabba to the Mettiya-Bhummajakā at the house of a rich man, who, discovering their identity, gave orders that they were to be fed anyhow. The Mettiya-Bhummajakā were greatly offended, and believing that Dabba had intended to slight them, induced one of their partisans, Mettiyā, to accuse Dabba of having seduced her. The charge was investigated, Mettiyā was expelled, and Dabba’s fame increased (Thag.v.5; Vin.ii.74ff; iii.158f, 166f, iv.37f; Sp.iii.598f). The Mettiya-Bhummajakā persuaded the Licchavi, Vaddha, to make a similar charge against Dabba regarding his wife (Vin.ii.124f). The Tandulanāli Jātaka (J.i.123f ) mentions another dispute, whereLāludāyi charges Dabba with not performing his duties conscientiously. Thereupon Lāludāyi was appointed to the task, but proved a failure.<br>Dabba was given the rank of chief of those who appointed lodgings (senāsanapaññāpakānam) (A.i.24) and was given the upasampadā ordination when only seven years old. He was called Dabba because he was said to be born of his mother while she was being burnt in the funeral pyre; when the flames were extinguished, the child was found lying on one of the posts of the pyre (dabbatthambhe) (ThagA.i.41; AA.i.152f).<br>He was a setthiputta in Hamsavatī in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and it was then that he conceived the desire for the rank of chief apportioner of lodgings. One hundred and three times he became king among devas and one hundred and five times king of men. In the time of Vipassī Buddha he spoke calumny about an arahant Thera, hence the conspiracy against him by the Mettiya-Bhummajakā. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he, with six others, went to the top of a hill, determined not to return till they had accomplished their purpose, but five of them died before this came to pass. The other four were Pukkusāti, Sabhiya, Bāhiya, and Kumārakassapa (DhA.ii.212; ThagA.i.44ff; Ap.ii.471f; UdA.81; Sp.ii.578f).<br>Dabba evidently died young. The Udana (Ud.viii.9; UdA.431f ) contains an account of his death. One day, returning from his alms rounds in Rājagaha, he saw that he had but a short while yet to live. He went, therefore, to the Buddha and, with his leave, showed various iddhi-powers and passed away.'],
'dabbapuppha jātaka':['There was once a jackal called Māyāvī.

A shipwrecked sailor from Kāsi stole this while the boar slept, and, with it, travelled to the Himālaya. There he saw the ascetics, and, in exchange for the gem, obtained from them their magic possessions, afterwards returning and killing them, so that he regained the gem. He then went to Benares and took possession of the throne, becoming known as King Dadhivāhana, because he destroyed his enemies by drowning them in a river of curds. In his garden grew a mango tree, sprung from a mango which had floated down from Lake Kannamuṇḍa. He sent fruits from this tree as presents to the neighbouring kings, but always pricked the mango stone with a thorn so that it should not bear fruit. Once, an offended king sent to Dadhivāhana a gardener whom he had bribed to destroy the flavour of the mangoes. The king gave him employment, but the gardener, by growing bitter creepers round the mango tree, destroyed the flavour of the fruit.

Vohāraka-Tissa erected a wall round the monastery (Mhv.vs.35) and Gothābhaya restored the uposatha hall (Mhv.vs.107). The thera Tissa, for whom Mahāsena built the Jetavana-vihāra, was an incumbent of Dakkhina-vihāra, in this context called Dakkhinārāma (Mhv.xxxvii.32).

'dakkhinadesa':['A province of Ceylon, the territory west of the mountains and reaching up to the sea. It was so called from the relation of its position to that of Anurādhapura.

'dakkhiṇāgiri':['Dakkhināgiri (v.l. Dakkhinagiri)<br>A janapada (district) in India, the capital of which wasUjjeni, and over which Asoka ruled as Viceroy.

The road from Sāvatthi to Rājagaha lay through Dakkhināgiri, and the Buddha traversed it in the course of his periodical tours through Magadha, residing in the Dakkhināgiri-vihāra in Ekanālā (S.i.172; SA.ii.133; Vin.i.80). It was during one of these tours that he convertedKasī-Bhāradvāja andDhammasava and his father. On another of these occasions the Buddha saw the Magadhakhetta, which gave him the idea of designing the robe of a monk to resemble a field (Vin.i.287). Ananda is also said to have travelled through Dakkhināgiri, gathering a large number of young men into the Order, who, however, do not appear to have been very serious in their intentions, as their behaviour earned for Ananda the censure ofMahā Kassapa (S.ii.217f). Later, we find Punna with a large following in Dakkhināgiri refusing to join in the findings of the Rājagaha Council, and preferring to follow the Dhamma according to his own lights (Vin.ii.289).<br>Dakkhināgiri was the residence of Nandamātā of Velukaṇṭaka and she was visited both by Sāriputta and by Moggallāna during a tour in the district (A.iv.64). In Dakkhināgiri, Sāriputta heard of the lack of zeal of Dhānañjāni (M.ii.185; see J.i.224 for another incident connected with Sāriputta’s tour). The Arāmadūsa Jātaka (q.v.) was preached in Dakkhināgiri.<br>The Dakkhināgiri-vihāra was, for a long time, a great monastic centre, and at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa there were present from there forty thousand monks led by Mahā Sangharakkhita.

It is probably identical with the Dakkhināgiridalha-vihāra, in which Aggabodhi I. erected an assembly-hall (Cv.xlii.27). It has sometimes been identified with the present Mulkirigala-vihāra (Cv.Trs.i.33, n.3).<br>It was once the residence of Appihā-Sāmanera (MT.552) and of Kāla Buddharakkhita (MA.i.469).'],
'dakkhināpatha':['In the old Pāli literature the name Dakkhināpatha would seem to indicate only a remote settlement or colony on the banks of the upperGodāvarī. Thus, we are told thatBāvarī had his hermitage in Dakkhināpatha territory, midway between the kingdoms of Assaka and Alaka (SN., vs.976). Elsewhere the name is coupled with Avanti as Avantidakkhināpatha and seems to refer, but more vaguely, to the same limited district. Vin.i.195, 196; ii.298. In J.v.133, however, Avanti is spoken of as a part of Dakkhināpatha (Dakkhinūpathe Avantirattha), but see J.iii.463, where Avantidakkhināpatha is spoken of.<br>The Sutta Nipāta Commentary (ii.580) seems to explain Dakkhināpatha as the road leading to the Dakkhinajanapada, while the Sumaṅgala-Vilāsinī (DA.i.265) takes Dakkhināpatha to be synonymous with Dakkhinajanapada and says that it was the district (janapada) south of the Ganges (Gangāya dakkhinato pākatajanapadam).<br>It is clear that, in the earlier literature at any rate, the word did not mean the whole country comprised in the modern word Dekkhan. It is possible that Dakkhināpatha was originally the name of the road which led southwards - the Aryan settlement at the end of the road, on the banks of theGodāvarī being also called by the same name - and that later the road lent its name to the whole region through which it passed. (For a detailed description see Law: Geog. of Early Buddhism, pp.60ff). In the Petavatthu Commentary (PvA., p.133) the Damila country (Damilavisaya) is included in the Dakkhināpatha.<br>The Dakkhināpatha is famous in literature as the birthplace of strong bullocks (DhSA.141; NidA.16; DhA.iii.248, etc.).

'dakkhināvibhaṅga sutta':['Once, when the Buddha was staying at the Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu, Pajāpatī Gotamī offered him two lengths of cloth woven by herself on her own loom.

Devala thereupon cursed him, saying that, at sunrise, his head would split in seven pieces; but Nārada stopped the sun from rising. The king enquired as to what had happened, and, on learning the story, forced Devala to ask Nārada’s pardon.

'devā':['1. Devā.-A class of beings.<br>As a title the word Devā is attributed to any being regarded, in certain respects, as being above the human level. Thus it is used for a king. In a late classification (CNid.307; KhA.123, etc.) there are three kinds of Devā:<br>sammutidevā (conventional gods - e.g., kings and princes); visuddhidevā (beings who are divine by the purity of their great religious merit - arahants and Buddhas); uppattidevā (beings who are born divine). Under the third category various groups are enumerated, the commonest number being seven:<br>Cātummahārājikā, Tāvatimsā, Yāmā, Tusitā, Nimmānaratī, Paranimmita-vasavattī Brahmakāyikā (E.g., D.i.216; A.i.210, etc.).<br>The longest list is that of the Majjhima Nikāya (i.289; iii.100. The Divyāvadāna p.266 contains a list of twenty-two), which contains the names of twenty-five groups.<br>The popular etymology of the word connects it with the root div in the sense of playing, sporting, or amusing oneself, sometimes also of shining: dibbantī ti devā, pañcahi kāmagunehi kīlanti, attano vā siriyā jotantī ti attho (KhA.123). The word implies possession of splendour and power of moving at will, beauty, goodness and effulgence of body, and, as such, is opposed to the dark powers of mischief and destruction - such as the Asuras, Petas and Nerayikas.<br>The Devās are generally regarded as sharing kinship and continuity of life with humans; all Devās have been men and may again be born among men. They take interest in the doings of men, especially the Cātummahārājikā and the gods of Tāvatimsa. They come to earth to worship the Buddha and to show reverence to good men. Sakka (q.v.) is usually spoken of as chief of the gods - devānam indo.<br>All Devās are themselves in samsāra, needing salvation. They are subject to death, their life-spans varying according to the merit of each individual deva. They are born in the full flower of youth and are free from illness till the moment of their death. Devas die from one of the following causes: exhaustion of life, merit or food; failing, through forgetfulness, to eat; and jealousy at the glory of another, which leads to anger. (DhA.l.173; for other particulars regarding devas see the article in the NPD).<br>When a deva is about to die five signs appear on him:<br>his clothes get soiled, flowers worn by him fade, sweat exudes from his armpits, his body loses its colour and he becomes restless on his seat. DA.ii.427f; DhSA, 33, etc.<br>2. Devā.-Daughter of Udaya I. and wife of Mahinda, son of the ādipāda Dāthāsiva.<br>Cv.xlix.12.<br>3. Devā.-Daughter of Dappula II. and wife of Kittaggabodhi. Cv.xlix.71.<br>4. Devā.-Wife of Kassapa V. and mother of Sakkasenāpati. She built, for the monks living in the wilderness, a vihāra called after herself, and adorned the Buddha-image at Maricavatti.

He then repeats what is given in Nos.1 and 2 above. S.i.229.'],
'devānampiyatissa':['King of Ceylon (247-207 B.C.). He was the second son of Mutasīva. It is said that on the day of his coronation many wonderful treasures miraculously appeared, some of which he resolved to send as tokens of esteem to his contemporary Dhammāsoka of India, with whom he had long been on terms of friendship. An embassy, led by his nephew Mahārittha, was despatched to Pātaliputta, and the emperor showed the ambassadors every mark of honour. He sent back with them all the requisites for a coronation, with instructions to celebrate the inauguration of the Sinhalese king, whom he invited to embrace Buddhism. On the return of the embassy, the king was solemnly crowned a second time. This confirmation of Devānampiyatissa’s sovereignty under the aegis of Asoka may have been due either to the commanding position of Asoka or for the strengthening of family connections. Asoka was a Moriyan (a branch of the Sākiyans) and Devānampiyatissa had Sākiyan blood.<br>The chief event in the reign of Devānampiyatissa was the arrival of Mahinda in Ceylon. He arrived at the head of a mission in the year of the king’s second coronation. Mahinda met the king hunting on the full-moon day of Jettha. The king welcomed him with great honour and speedily embraced the new religion, to which Asoka had already drawn his attention.<br>His conversion was the direct result of Mahinda’s preaching of the Cūlahatthipadopama Sutta. His earlier religion is not known, it may have been Jainism. His example was followed by a large number of his subjects, many of whom entered the Order. Devānampiyatissa dedicated to their use the Nandana park and the Mahāmeghavana, which he himself had laid out a little earlier. In the Mahāmeghavana he built the famous Mahā-Vihāra which, for many centuries, remained the centre of the orthodox religion in Ceylon. The dedication of the Mahā-Vihāra took place in the two hundred and thirty-sixth year after the death of the Buddha. The king’s next pious work was the erection of the Cetiyapabbata-vihāra and he, later, built the Thūpārāma, containing the Buddha’s right collar-bone.<br>When the women of the palace, led by Anulā, wife of the sub-king, Mahānāga, expressed a desire to become nuns, Devānampiyatissa sent another embassy to Asoka asking him to send Sanghamittā, together with the right branch of the sacred Bodhi-tree. This branch miraculously severed itself from the parent tree and, together with Sanghamittā, was conveyed down the Ganges and arrived in Jambukola, where it was received with all honour by Devānampiyatissa. From Jambukola it was taken in procession to Anurādhapura, where it was planted in the Mahāmeghavana, the king instituting in its honour a festival, which was observed for many centuries. For the use of Sanghamittā and the nuns the king erected various buildings, the chief of which was the Hatthālhaka-vihāra and the Upāsikā-vihāra with its twelve mansions. (This account is summarised from the Mahāvamsa (chaps.xi., xiii.-xx.); also Dpv.xi.14ff; xii.7; xvii.92).<br>Among other works of Devānampiyatissa we are told of the building of the Issarasamana- and the Vessagiri-vihāras, the refectory called Mahāpāli, the Jambukola-vihāra in Nāgadīpa, the Tissamahā-vihāra, the Pācīnārāma and the Pathamathūpa. He also built the Tissavāpi at Anurādhapura. (The Cv. (xxxvii.94) mentions also the Dhammacakka as having been built by Devānampiyatissa. It later became the Temple of the Tooth at Anurādhapura).<br>Mahinda survived him by eight years. Devānampiyatissa seems to have died without issue, for he was succeeded by four of his brothers.'],

Similarly should any fear arise in the mind of a monk he should recall to mind the excellences of the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Sangha, and peace would come to him (S.i.218f).<br>This sutta is also included among the Parittas and is called the Dhajagga Paritta (E.g., Mil.150).<br>It is said that once a sāmanera, helping to plaster the Dīghavāpi cetiya, fell from the top.

On being asked by the Buddha why he did so, the king replied that he perceived the marvellous effects of the Buddha’s teaching on his disciples. They were well controlled, yet joyful, buoyant, with hearts as free as those of wild creatures; and he added that he knew of no such discipline outside the Buddha’s teaching. He then proceeded to tell the Buddha of his own servants, Isidatta and Purāna, and of their great devotion to the Buddha, reminding the Buddha that they were both Kosalan nobles of about the same age.

The Sāsanavamsa (p.33) records that he lived at Badaratittha in South India.<br>His works show that he was a native of Kāñcipura. His period is uncertain, though it is generally agreed that he is posterior to Buddhaghosa. He seems to have studied in the Mahāvihāra, because he mentions this fact in the introduction to his books (e.g., the Petavatthu Commentary). It is quite likely that he studied the Tamil Commentaries as well and that he wrote at Badaratittha. (Hiouen Thsang, Beal.ii.229, says that Dhammapāla was a clever youth of Kāñcipura and that the king gave him his daughter. But Dhammapāla, not wishing to marry, prayed before an image of the Buddha. The gods took him to a place far away where he was ordained by the monks).<br>The Khuddaka Nikāya was his chief study, and seven of his works are commentaries on the books of poetry preserved in the Canon - the Thera- and Theri-Gāthā, Udāna, Vimāna- and Peta-Vatthu, Itivuttaka and Cariyāpitaka. His other works are a commentary on the Netti, and on the Visuddhi-magga (called the Paramatthamañjūsā), tīkās (called Līnatthavannanā) on Buddhaghosa’s Commentaries to the Four Nikāyas and another on the Jātakaṭṭhakathā. He is also credited with having written a tīkā on the Buddhavamsa Commentary and on the Abhidhammaṭṭhakathā.<br>9. Dhammapāla.-A thera of Ceylon, generally called Culla-Dhammapāla. He was the senior pupil of Vanaratana Ananda and wrote the Saccasankhepa. He is also credited with tīkās on several works, including a Līnathavannanā on Ananda’s Mūlatikā.

'dhammaruci':['1. Dhammaruci.-One of the heterodox sects of Ceylon which branched off from the Theravāda (Mhv.v.13).<br>According to the Nikāya Sangraha (p.11) this secession took place four hundred and fifty-four years after the death of the Buddha, and in the fifteenth year of the reign of Vattagāmāni Abhaya. The Nikāya Sangraha gives an account of the origin of this sect. A monk called Mahā-Tissa, incumbent of Abhayagiri, was convicted of living in domestic intercourse and expelled by the Mahāvihāra fraternity. He thereupon left with his followers and lived apart at Abhayagiri. They were strengthened by the arrival of some monks from Pallarārāma in South India, descendants of the Vajjiputtakas. Their teacher was Dhammaruci, and when they joined the Abhayagiri monks, Mahā-Tissa himself took the name of Dhammaruci and his followers became known as Dhammarucikas.<br>The Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.176) says that Dhammarucika was the name given to the monks of Abhayagiri when they seceded from the Mahāvihāra, and gives elsewhere (p.676f) the points on which they differed from the Theravādins. These points concerned minor teachings of the Vinaya. The Dhammarucikas became active in the time of Meghavannābhaya, and the king, after an enquiry into the matter, sent sixty of them into exile. They again became powerful in the time of Mahāsena, through the influence of Sanghamitta, and almost succeeded in destroying the Mahāvihāra. But this disaster was averted by the intervention of the king’s friend and counsellor, Meghavannābhaya, and Sanghamitta was killed by one of the queens (Mhv.xxxvii.17ff).<br>In spite of Sanghamitta’s untimely end, the Dhammarucikas seem to have enjoyed favour in Ceylon during a long period. Dhātusena gave over to them the Ambatthala-vihāra, which he built on Cetiyapabbata (Cv.xxxviii.75), and Kassapa I, bestowed on them the vihāra he built in the Niyyanti garden, and made all provisions for their comfort (Cv.xxxix.17). Moggallāna I, gave over to them the Dalha-vihāra (Cv.xxxix.41) and Aggabodhi V. the Rājinādīpika-vihāra (Cv.xlviii.1). Sena Ilaṅga, general of Kassapa IV., built for them the Dhammārāma and the Hadayunha-parivena (Cv.lii.17, 18).<br>The Sāgaliyas were an offshoot of the Dhammarucikas.<br>2. Dhammaruci Thera.-An arahant. In the time of Dipankara Buddha he was a young man named Megha, and on hearing the Buddha’s declaration regarding Sumedha, he entered the Order under the latter. But, owing to wrong association, he left the Order and murdered his mother. For this he suffered in Avīci and was later born as a fish. One day he heard some shipwrecked sailors calling on the name of Gotama Buddha for protection, and, remembering Dipankara’s prophecy, the fish died. He was then born in Sāvatthi, and hearing the Buddha preach at Jetavana, he entered the Order and became an arahant. Ap.ii.429f.<br>3.

The Buddha heard the song at Sāvatthi, seven hundred leagues away, and having travelled through the air, stood over Dhaniya’s dwelling. As Dhaniya proceeded with his song, the Buddha added a verse to each one of Dhaniya’s. At the end of this song Dhaniya, his wife, and two of his daughters, became sotāpannas.

Three times this happened, until, in exasperation, Dhaniya very skilfully made bricks and tiles and built a hut both strong and splendid, with tiles of shining crimson which gave out a bell-like sound when tapped. The Buddha, seeing this, chided Dhaniya and ordered the hut to be pulled down. Dhaniya then built a hut of wood which he obtained from a guild of timber merchants, suppliers of wood to the king, giving them to understand that he had the king’s permission. Vassakāra, hearing of this, reported the matter to Bimbisāra, who sent for Dhaniya. Dhaniya maintained that the king, by royal proclamation, had permitted the monks to use the royal supplies of wood and other materials. Bimbisāra admitted the proclamation, but said it referred only to supplies straight from the forest, and he sent Dhaniya away with a warning. The matter created a great uproar and the Buddha blamed Dhaniya. Vin.iii.41-5; Sp.ii.286.<br>Dhaniya later changed his ways and became an arahant. In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a householder and gave the Buddha a reed-chain (? nalamālā). He is probably identical with Nalamāliya of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.412.'],

Their conversation turned on the war whichPasenadi was waging againstAjātasattu.<br>Tissa, maintaining that Pasenadi was ignorant of the arts of war, proceeded to describe in detail what Pasenadi should do if he wished for victory. Some courtiers, overhearing the conversation, reported it to Pasenadi, who, profiting by it, re-entered the battle and captured Ajātasattu alive.<br>When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he related theVaddhaki-sūkara Jātaka to show that in the past, too, Tissa had been skilled in the art of warfare (J.ii.403f). The Tacchasūkara Jātaka (J.iv.343, 354) was also related in this connection.'],

One day he was caught in a snare on the lake Khemā, set by the orders of King Bahuputtaka. Dhatarattha’s friend, Sumukha, refused to leave him while he was caught. The two friends melted the heart of the hunter when he came to take Dhatarattha, and later they were brought before the king. Dhatarattha preached the Doctrine to the king and to his queen, Khemā, who longed to hear a hamsa preach (J.iv.425ff; for details see theHamsa Jātaka). Dhatarattha is often referred toe as a king surrounded by a splendid following. E.g., DA.i.40; MA.ii.576; UdA.57, 412; PvA.171.<br>6. Dhatarattha.-The family of hamsas to which belonged Dhatarattha, king of the hamsas. The members of this family are called Dhataratthā. They were golden-coloured and lived in Cittakūta. The Mahā-Sutasoma Jātaka (J.v.345, 355, 357) contains a story of the complete destruction of these hamsas. They lived in Kañcanaguhā, and during the four months of the rainy season would not leave their cave, in case their wings should be drenched with water and they fell into the sea. A spider, as big as a cartwheel, used to weave a thick web at the entrance to the cave, but the Dhatarattha geese sent one of their young ones, who had received two portions of food, to cut through the web. One season, however, the rains lasted for four months, and the hamsas became cannibals and thus lost their strength. When, at the end of the rains, they tried to break through the web, they failed, and the spider cut off their heads one by one and drank their blood. This was the end of the Dhatarattha hamsas.

Sāriputta, hearing of his fall from the ways of earnestness - after the death of his first pious wife and his marriage to another - visited Dhānañjāni and pointed out to him that if he departed from equity and righteousness he could not hope to be excused on the plea that his fall was due to force of circumstances. Dhānañjāni profited by the discourse, and later, when he was ill, he sent word to Sāriputta, told him of his dire illness, and expressed his wish to be born in one of the Brahma-worlds. Sāriputta taught how union with Brahmā could be attained. Soon after, Dhānañjāni died, and the Buddha said that he was born in one of the lower Brahma-worlds. M.ii.184ff.<br>2. Dhānañjāni.-A brahminee, probably of Rājagaha. She was married to a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja-gotta. One day, while serving her husband’s dinner, she sang the praises of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Order. The brahmin, very annoyed, threatens to go to the Buddha and abuse him. His wife encourages him to go. He goes, has a discussion with the Buddha, and is converted. Later, he joins the Order and, in due course, becomes an arahant (S.i.159f).<br>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.175ff) the brahminee was a sotāpanna and that she would constantly sing the praises of the Buddha while engaged in her duties and that the brahmin closed his ears to it. One day he invited a large number of his friends to a banquet, and, on the eve of the great day, asked her to promise not to offend his brahmin friends by her udāna. She refused to give any such promise, even when he threatened to cut her with a dagger. She declared herself ready to suffer, and sang five hundred verses on her theme. The brahmin surrendered. While waiting on the guests, her impulse became too great for her, and, laying down bowl and spoon, she started repeating her song of praise. The scandalised guests hurried away, spitting out the food, defiled by the presence of a heretic, and her husband scolded her for the spoiled feast. She may be the woman who was responsible for the visit of Sangārava to the Buddha. The latter is, however, stated to have lived inCandalakappa (M.ii.209).<br>3.

According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p.289), Dīghasandaka was so called because he wore a long robe (dīghasāttakam nivāsesīti Dīghasandako), and the original name of the parivena built by him was Cūlapāsāda.'],

He pointed out to them the impropriety of a quarrel over anything connected with the Buddha, the teacher of Peace. The claimants thereupon asked Dona to undertake the distribution of the relics. He divided them into eight parts, one of which he gave to each king. He himself kept the vessel used for collecting and dividing the relics, and over it he built a thūpa, celebrating a feast in its honour (D.ii.166f; Bu.xxviii.4; UdA.402).<br>Dona first met the Buddha on the road between Ukkatthā and Setavyā. He saw the Buddha’s footprints and, following them, he came upon the Buddha seated at the foot of a-tree. Dona asked him various questions as to his identity and the Buddha explained to him his Buddha-hood (A.ii.37f). The Commentary (AA.ii.505f) states that Dona was a teacher with a large following, and that the Buddha’s journey to Setavyā was undertaken for the purpose of meeting him. At the end of the Buddha’s discourse, Dona became an anāgāmī and composed a poem of twelve thousand words in praise of the Buddha. This poem became known as the Donagajjita. Dona was held in very high esteem as a teacher, and it is said (DA.ii.607f) that, at some time or other practically all the chiefs of Jambudīpa had sat at his feet. Therefore he was able to dissuade them from quarrelling over the Buddha’s relics. On that occasion he stood on a hill and recited the Donagajjita. At first his voice could not be heard through the uproar, but, by degrees, they recognised his voice and listened with wrapt attention.<br>At the distribution of the relics, Dona, watching his opportunity, hid, in his turban, the right eye-tooth of the Buddha, but Sakka saw this, and thinking that Dona was incapable of rendering suitable honour to this relic, removed it and placed it in the Cūlāmani-cetiya (DA.ii.609).<br>2.

In this position Ekarāja cultivated thoughts of loving-kindness towards his enemy and attained a stage of complete absorption in mystic meditation. His bonds burst and he sat cross-legged in mid air. Dabbasena was, meanwhile, seized with a burning pain in his body and, on the advice of his courtiers, had Ekarāja released, whereupon the pains disappeared. Realising Ekarāja’s holiness, Dabbasena restored the kingdom to him and asked his forgiveness (J.iii.13-15).<br>In the Ekarāja Jātaka, reference is made to the Mahāsīlava Jātaka for details regarding the expulsion of the minister for misconduct and of the subsequent events. But there the king is called Sīlava and not Ekarāja. The two stories contain certain similarities but the details vary very much. See also the Seyya Jātaka, where the king is called<br>Kamsa, and compare it with the Ghata Jātaka. The Ekarāja Jātaka is given as an example of a birth in which the Bodhisatta practised mettā to perfection (E.g., BuA.51; Mbv.11). The story of Ekarāja is the last in the Cariyā-Pitaka (No. xiv).<br>According to the Cariyā Pitaka Commentary (p.205), Ekarāja was a title given to the king on account of his great power, in which case his real name might have been Sīlava, as mentioned above. The scholiast on the Ekarāja Jātaka (J.iii.14), however, says that Ekarāja was the king’s personal name.<br>2. Ekarāja.-King of Pupphavatī (Benares). He was the son of Vasavatti and the father of Candakumāra. For his story see the Khandahāla Jātaka (J.vi.131ff). He belonged to theKondaññagotta (J.vi.137).'],
'ekasankhiya thera':['An arahant. In the past, when a festival was being held in honour of Vipassī&#39;s Bodhi-tree, be blew a conch-shell for a whole day as homage to the Buddha. Seventy-one kappas ago he became a king named Sudassana. Ap.ii.391.'],

Forty kappas ago he was a king named Varuṇa (Ap.i.121).<br>The Apadāna Commentary says he was given the name Ekasaññaka because in his last life he remembered his gift to Khanda.<br>2.

'ekasālā':['A Brahmin village in the Kosala kingdom.<br>The Buddha once stayed there, and when a large congregation of the laity were listening to him, Māra, thinking to darken their intelligence, suggested to him that he should not teach others. The Buddha refuted the suggestion of Māra, who retired discomfited. S.i.111.'],
'ekasāṭaka':['A very poor brahmin who lived in the time of Vipassī Buddha. He was so called because he and his wife had, between them, only one upper garment, worn by whichever of them happened to be going out. The Buddha was in the habit of preaching every seven years. On one such occasion the brahmin listened to the Buddha’s sermon, and being greatly pleased, wishing to make an offering, he gave the Buddha his upper garment after a hard mental struggle as to whether he could afford the gift. Having made the gift, he shouted with joy saying, ”I have won.” The king of the city, Bandhumā, having heard the shout and learnt the reason, gave to the brahmin various rich gifts, including the sabbaṭṭhaka (*), all of which the latter presented to the Buddha, keeping, at the king’s special request, a single pair of garments for himself and his wife. The king later made Ekasātaka his chaplain (AA.i.92ff; also ThagA.ii.136).<br>(*) The sabbaṭṭhaka seems to have been a gift of various things in groups of eight: eight elephants, eight horses, eight thousand pieces of money, etc. (DhA.iii.3); but see Mil.Trs.ii.147, n.1, where it is spoken of as an office.<br>Ekasātaka is given in the Anguttara Commentary (loc. cit.) as a previous birth of the Elder Mahā Kassapa. The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.1ff) mentions another brahmin, Culla-Ekasātaka by name. He is, however, stated as having lived in the time of Gotama Buddha, although the story related is, in most respects, identical with that given above, except that the king in the story of Culla-Ekasātaka is Pasenadi, king of Kosala. No mention is made of the brahmin being created purohita. Moreover, this brahmin received as gift only the sabbacatukka (groups of four) and not the sabaṭṭhaka. More important still, Culla Ekasātaka is identified with Mahā Ekasātaka, the latter being mentioned as having lived in the time of Vipassī Buddha. Here we evidently have a confusion of legends.<br>The story of Ekasātaka is related in the Milindapañha (pp.115, 291), as one of seven cases in which an act of devotion received its reward in this very life.'],
'ekatthambha':['One of the buildings erected by Parakkamabāhu I.<br>It rose sheer from the ground and was crowned with a mankara (dolphin).<br>In it was a golden chamber on a golden column, resembling a cave, for the use of the king. Cv.lxxiii.92ff; see also Cv.Trs.ii.11, n.4.'],
'ekavajjaka':['A king. He was extremely obliging, and would grant an interview to any who desired it, no matter what the circumstances. He always allowed the person interviewing him to do so unattended, and thence came to be known as Ekavajjaka (”going alone”). Once, two of his ministers quarrelled because they wanted to rule over the same district.

Ekāsanadāyaka.-A Thera. In the time of Padumuttara, he, with his wife, left the deva-world, and coming amongst men waited upon a monk named Devala (Ap.i.226).'],
'ekuddāna':['An arahant. He was the son of a wealthy brahmin of Sāvatthi, and being convinced of the Buddha’s majesty, as seen at the presentation of the Jetavana, he entered the Order. He dwelt in the forest fulfilling his novitiate, and once came to the Buddha to learn of him. The Buddha, seeing Sāriputta near him wrapt in contemplation, uttered a stanza, that to the monk of lofty thoughts and heedful, sorrow comes not (See Dhammapada, 259). The monk learnt this stanza, and returning to the forest, ever and anon reflected on it. He thus came to be called Ekuddāniya. One day he obtained insight and became an arahant. Later, when Ananda asked him to preach a sermon, it was this stanza that he took as his text.<br>We are told that in the time of Atthadassī Buddha he was a chief of the yakkhas, and when the Buddha died he went about lamenting that he had not made use of his opportunities. A disciple of the Buddha, named Sāgara, meeting him, advised him to make offering to the Buddha’s thūpa. In Kassapa’s time he was a householder, and heard the Buddha utter the stanza mentioned above. He entered the Order, and for twenty thousand years practised meditation, repeating the stanza, but gained no attainment (ThagA.i.153f; Thag.v.68).<br>It is said (DhA.iii.384f) that on fast-days Ekuddāna, alone in the forest, sounded the call for the deities of the forest to attend the preaching of the Law, and uttered his stanza, whereupon the deities made loud applause. One fast-day two monks, versed in the Tipitaka, visited Ekuddāna with a retinue of five hundred each. Seeing them, Ekuddāna’s heart was glad and he said: ”Today we will listen to the Law.” On being asked for an explanation, he described how, when the Dhamma was expounded, the forest grove was filled with the applause of devas. Thereupon one of the Elders recited the Dhamma and the other expounded it, but there was no sound. In order to dispel their doubts, Ekuddāna took his seat and pronounced his one stanza. The sound of the plaudits of the devas filled the forest. The Elders were greatly offended at the conduct of the devas and complained to the Buddha. The Buddha explained to them that the important thing was not the amount of knowledge but the quality of the understanding.<br>It is noteworthy that the verse, attributed above to Ekuddāniya, occurs in the Vinaya (Vin.iv.54) as having been constantly used by Cūlapanthaka. Whenever it was his turn to preach to the nuns at Sāvatthi they expected no effective lesson, since he always repeated the same stanza, namely, that which is above attributed to Ekuddāniya. The thera, bearing of their remarks, forthwith gives an exhibition of his iddhi-power and of his knowledge of the Dhamma, thereby winning their tribute of admiration.'],

Seeing the King Bandhumā keeping the fast, she took the precepts herself and kept them well. Sixty-four times she became the queen of rulers in heaven, and was sixty-three times queen among men. Her complexion was always of a golden hue. In her last life she left the world at the age of seven, and attained arahantship within eight months (Ap.ii.522f).<br>She is probably identical with Uttamā Therī. See ThigA.46ff.'],
'elakamāra':['King of Benares. The king of Kosala invaded his father’s kingdom and, having killed the king, took away the queen, who was pregnant. When the child was born he was cast into the cemetery lest he should be slain by the Kosala king. The boy was discovered by a goatherd and brought up as his son, but from the day of the boy’s arrival in the goatherd’s home, the latter’s animals began to die off. He was therefore named Elakamāra (”Goat’s Bane”). The goatherd, thereupon, put him into a pot and cast him into the river, where he was picked up by a low-caste mender of old rubbish and adopted as his son. When he grew up the boy went to the palace with his father, and there the princess Kuraṅgavī, of great beauty, fell in love with him. The servants discovered them guilty of illicit relations and reported them to the king. When the lad was about to be put to death for his misdemeanour, the queen; possessed by the spirit of Elakamāra’s dead father, who had been born as his guardian angel, confessed that he was no mere outcaste, but the son of the king of Benares. The Kosala king restored to Elakamāra his father’s inheritance and married him to Kuraṅgavī. Chalaṅgakumāra was given to him as his teacher, and was later appointed commander-in-chief.<br>Kuraṅgavī misbehaved with Chalaṅgakumāra as well as with his servant, Dhanantevāsī (J.v.430ff).<br>The story of Elakamāra was one of the stories mentioned by Kunāla in his famous sermon on the frailty of women (J.v.424).'],
'eḷāra':['King of Anurādhapura (145-101 B.C.) He was a native of Cola, and having come to Ceylon, overpowered the reigning king, Asela, and captured the throne. The Mahāvamsa says (Mhv.xxi.14f ) that he ruled with ”even justice towards friend and foe,” and many stories are related showing his love of fairness and his kindness. Although an unbeliever, he paid the greatest respect to Buddhism, and he is credited with having persuaded the gods, by his determination, to send rain over his kingdom only at convenient times. Elāra had a general named Mitta (Mhv.xxiii.4); the chief of his forces was Dīghajantu, while his royal elephant was called Mahāpabbata. In the great battle between Elāra’s forces and the Sinhalese soldiers under Dutthagāmaṇī, Elāra was slain in single contest with the latter. In recognition of the dead king’s chivalry, great honours were paid to him at his funeral and a monument was erected over his ashes. For many generations all music was stopped while passing the monument as a mark of respect to the honoured dead (Mhv.xxv.54-74; Dpv.xxiii.49ff).<br>According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (p. 483), a shrine was erected on the spot where Elāra’s ashes were buried, and it was called the Elārapatimāghara.

His parents married him to a suitable wife but, because it was his last life, he sought the Buddha. After hearing the Buddha preach he left the world, but for several days he was overcome by evil thoughts.

'erakapatta':['A Nāga king. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a monk. One day, while in a boat, he grasped an eraka-leaf, and through his failing to let go, the leaf was broken off. Though he practised meditation for twenty thousand years in the forest, at the moment of his death he thought of the lapse with great remorse and was reborn in the Nāga world as large as a dug-out canoe, much to his grief and despair. When a daughter was born to him he taught her a song and, once a fortnight, he appeared with her on the surface of the Ganges, where she danced on his hood and sang the song. She was offered in marriage to anyone who could sing a reply to her song. Erakapatta hoped thereby to become aware of it when a Buddha should appear in the world. Many suitors came, and an interval between two Buddhas passed and still no one was successful. At last a young brahmin, Uttara (q.v.), well-schooled for the task by the Buddha, appeared before the<br>Nāga-maiden and answered all her questions. (Uttara himself became a sotāpanna when he finished learning his lesson from the Buddha.) Erakapatta at once knew that a Buddha had come, and asked Uttara to take him to the Teacher. At the sight of the Buddha, Erakapatta was seized with great sorrow on account of his condition, but the Buddha preached to him and consoled him. It is said that the Nāga king would have attained the Fruit of Conversion had it not been for his animal nature. DhA.iii.230-6.'],

'erāvaṇa':['1. Erāvana.-Sakka’s elephant. He was once the elephant of the king of Magadha, who gave him toMāgha and his companions to help them in their good works on earth. As a result, when Magha and the others were reborn in Tāvatimsa, Erāvana was born there himself and became their companion. Ordinarily he was a deva like the others, because there are no animals in the deva-world, but when they went to the park to play, Erāvana assumed the form of an elephant, one hundred and fifty leagues in size. For the thirty-three devas Erāvana erected thirty-three heads (kumbha), each two or three quarters of a league in girth. Each head had seven tusks, each fifty leagues long, each tusk bore seven lotus plants, each plant seven flowers, each flower seven leaves, and on each leaf danced seven nymphs (Padumaceharā). For Sakka himself there was a special head, Sudassana, thirty leagues around, above it a canopy of twelve leagues all of precious stones.

It is emphasised in several places (E.g., MA.i.472; DA.ii.688; also VvA.15 and Kvu.ii.599) that Erāvana is a devaputta and a Nāga only by birth (jātiyā).

This boon had been granted him in return for twelve years’ services to Vessavana. The two travellers from Kāsi took up their abode in the hall for one night, during which the father sneezed. The son, knowing nothing of his danger, said nothing, but on seeing the yakkha preparing to eat him, he guessed the reason and hastened to wish his father long life. The father acted likewise, and the yakkha was foiled in his attempt on their lives. The Bodhisatta, having heard the yakkha’s story, established him in the five precepts.

'gajabāhu':['King of Ceylon (1137-1153). He was the son of Vikkamabāhu II. and succeeded his father to the throne (Cv.lx.88, according to the Dimbulāgala Inscription, his mother was Sundarī). Thus he was the grandson of Vijayabāhu I and of Tilokasundarī, and came, therefore, of Kālinga stock. When he saw the increasing power of the Prince Parakkamabāhu (afterwards Parakkamabāhu I.), Gajabāhu sent for him with many marks of favour and welcomed him at his court. In order to win the king’s confidence Parakkama gave his sister Bhaddavati to be his queen, but when he saw that Gajabāhu was becoming suspicious of his power he left Pulatthipura and made preparations to wage war against him. In the campaign that followed, Gajabāhu suffered many reverses and, in the end, fell into the hands of Parakkama’s forces. With great difficulty Parakkama saved him from death, but in the meantime Mānābharaṇa managed to get Gajabāhu into his power and cast him into a dungeon. From there he was rescued by Parakkamabāhu and fled to Kotthasāra. Meanwhile, Parakkamabāhu had consolidated his power, and his officers captured Pulatthipura. Gajabāhu, being able to see no other help, implored the monks of Pulatthipura to intercede on his behalf, and, at their request, Parakkamabāhu left to Gajabāhu the enjoyment of his possessions. (This is rather odd, especially in view of the fact that he invited heretical nobles to come to Ceylon, Cv.lxx.53). Gajabāhu took up his abode at Gangātalāka and spent his last days there in comparative peace. As he had no heir and no brothers, he bequeathed his kingdom to Parakkamabāhu, and engraved his will on a stone tablet at Mandalagiri Vihāra. He was cremated at Kotthasāra.

Among the assembled multitude was a villager, who felt that he would die unless he could obtain a morsel of Gandha’s rice. When this was told to Gandha he suggested that the man should work for him for three years, taking in payment a bowl of his rice. The villager agreed and henceforth became known as Bhattabhatika. At the end of the three years Gandha kept his promise and gave orders that Bhattabhatika should enjoy all his master’s own splendours for one day, and asked all the members of his household, except his wife Cintāmanī, to wait on him.

They are generally classed together with theAsuras and the Nāgas (E.g., A.iv.200, 204, 207). Beings are born among them as a result of having practised the lowest form of sīla (D.ii.212, 271).<br>It is a disgrace for a monk to be born in the Gandhabba-world (D.ii.221, 251, 273f). The Gandhabbas are regarded as the heavenly musicians, andPañcasikha, Suriyavaccasā and her father Timbarū are among their number (D.ii.264).<br>They wait on such devas as Sakka, and the males among them form the masculine counterpart of the accharā, the nymphs.

The Buddha says that beings are born among the Gandhabakāyikā devā because they wish to be so; they are described as dwelling in the fragrance of root-wood, of bark and sap, and in that of flowers and scents (S.iii.250f).<br>It is often stated that the Gandhabbas preside over conception; this is due to an erroneous translation of the word gandhabba in passages (E.g., M.i.157, 265f) dealing with the circumstances necessary for conception (mātāpitaro ca sannipatitā honti, mātā ca utunī hoti, gandhabbo ca paccupatthito hoti).<br>The Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.481f ) explain that here gandhabba means tatrūpakasatta - tasmim okāse nibbattanako satto - meaning a being fit and ready to be born to the parents concerned.

It is crowned with a tableland, is green in colour (muggavanna), and covered with various medicinal plants.

When a new Pacceka Buddha arises in the world, he goes first to Gandha-mādana and other Pacceka Buddhas, who may be in the world, assemble there to greet him, and they all sit rapt in samādhi. Then the senior among them asks the new-comer to describe how he came to be a Pacceka Buddha (SNA.i.52, 66f; ii.437; AA.ii.759; UdA.300, etc.; MA.ii.585).<br>The Pacceka Buddhas who live on Gandhamādana will often enter into samādhi for seven days, and at the end of that period seek alms from someone on whom they wish to bestow a special favour, that he may thereby obtain merit (E.g., DhA.iii.368f; iv.121, 199f; J.iv.16). These Buddhas will sometimes leave the mountain, and, having admonished those whom they wish to help, return again (E.g., J.iii.453).<br>Besides Pacceka Buddhas, others are also mentioned as having resided in Gandhamādana - e.g., Nārada (J.iv.393), Nalinikā (J.v.186), Bahusodarī (J.vi.83); also the deva king Nāgadatta (ThagA.i.138), and Vessantara, with his family, after he renounced his kingdom (J.vi.528f.). It is also said that Kinnaras (J.iv.438) and Nāgas (Rockhill, 169) lived on the slopes of Gandhamādana. It was among the places visited by Khadira-vaniya Revata (AA.i.139).<br>It is not explicitly mentioned that all Pacceka Buddhas die in Gandhamādana, but the inference seems to be such. Thus, once, five hundred Pacceka Buddhas led by Mahāpaduma died there, and their bodies were cremated (ThagA.ii.141).<br>The Jātaka Commentary (vi.79) explains Gandhamādana as gandhena mada-karo pabbato.<br>The fragrant tree Bhujaka grows only in heaven and in Gandhamādana (VvA.162).<br>It is said that the Buddha Metteya will retire for a while to Gandhamādanā, after spending his first rainy season (Anāgatavamsa v.81).'],

'gandhāra':['A charm whereby one could become invisible and multiform, pass through all obstacles, through earth and water, and touch the sun and moon (D.i.213). Elsewhere (J.iv.498) the charm is mentioned as being only useful for the purpose of making oneself invisible.<br>The Theragāthā Commentary (I.51f) distinguishes a Lesser and a Greater. Pilinda-vaccha knew the former and thought that the Buddha would teach him the other.

Gandhāra.-A Pacceka Buddha mentioned in a nominal list. M.iii.69; ApA.i.106.<br>2. Gandhāra.-One of the sixteen Mahājanapadas (countries) (A.i.213; iv.252, etc.; in the Niddesa and Mahāvastu lists Gandhāra is omitted and others substituted). Its capital wasTakkasilā, famous for its university; its king in the time of the Buddha was Pukkusāti. There was friendly intercourse between him and Bimbisāra of Magadha. Merchants and visitors from one country to another were lodged and fed at the expense of the country’s king, and no tariffs were levied on their merchandise. There was constant exchange of goods and valuables, and on one occasion Bimbisāra, wishing to send his friend a gift of particular value, dispatched to him a letter containing news of the appearance in the world of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. When Pukkusāti read the letter he decided to become a follower of the Buddha, and ordained himself as a monk; then, leaving his kingdom, he travelled all the way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha (MA.ii.979ff). This conversion of Gandhāra’s’ king, however, does not seem to have had the effect of converting the rest of its people to the Buddha’s faith. The memory of Pukkusāti was evidently soon forgotten, for we find Moggaliputta Tissa, at the conclusion of the Third Council, sending the Thera Majjhantika to convert Gandhāra (Mhv.xii.3ff).<br>According to Buddhaghosa’s account, Pukkusāti’s kingdom was over one hundred leagues in extent (MA.ii.988), and the distance from Takkasilā to Sāvatthi was one hundred and ninety-two leagues (MA.ii.987; from Benares it was one hundred and twenty leagues, vīsamyo-janasata; J.i.395; ii.47). There was evidently a well-known caravan route linking the two countries, although Gandhāra was regarded as a paccantima janapada. (MA.ii.982; there was also constant trade between Gandhāra and Videha, J.iii.365ff. It would appear from the Mahā Niddesa i.154 that Takkasilā was a regular centre of trade).<br>At the time of Majjhantika’s visit, the people of Gandhāra were being harassed by the Nāga-king Aravāla, and the chronicles contain details of his conversion by the monk. The Nāga-king, together with his retinue, the yakkha Pandaka and his wife Hāritā, became devout followers of the Buddha. Majjhantika preached theāsīvisūpama Sutta, and many thousands joined the Order. (Mhv.xii.9ff; Smp.i.64f; Dpv.viii.4).<br>Gandhāra appears to have included Kasmīra, the two countries being always mentioned together as Kasmīra-Gandhāra. They occupied the sites of the modern districts of Peshawar and Rawalpindi in the northern Punjab (PHAI. p.93). In the time of Asoka the country formed part of his empire, and is mentioned as such in Rock Edict V. Before that it was subject to the Achaemenid kings. Gandhāra was always famous for its red woollen shawls (kambala) (SNA.ii.487; J.vi.501).<br>Another king of Takkasilā besides Pukkusāti is mentioned - namely, Naggaji, who was a contemporary of Nimi, king of Videha. (J.iii.377; cf. Ait. Brāhmana vii.34; Sat. Brāhmana viii.1, 4, 10; see also Gandhārarājā).<br>One of the eye teeth of the Buddha was deposited in Gandhāra (Bu.xxviii.6; D.ii.167).'],
'gandhāra jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once king of Gandhāra, and he and the king of Videha became friends, though they never saw each other.

They met in Himavā, but failed to recognise each other until, seeing another eclipse of the moon, they exchanged reminiscences. They went out begging together, and the Videha ascetic, having once been given a large quantity of salt, stored up some of it for a saltless day.

He was reborn as son of the king of Benares, and later became king under the name of Udaya. On meeting Addhamāsaka (q.v.), Udaya shared the kingdom with him, but one day Addhamāsaka, discovering that he harboured a desire to kill Udaya, renounced his kingdom and became an ascetic. When Udaya heard of this he uttered a stanza, referring to his own past life, but no one could understand the meaning of it. The queen, anxious to learn the meaning, told the king’s barber Gaṅgamāla how he might win the king’s favour, and when the king offered him a boon, Gaṅgamāla chose to have the stanza explained to him. When he learnt how Udaya had won a kingdom as a result of having kept the fast for half a day, Gaṅgamāla renounced the world and, developing asceticism, became a Pacceka Buddha. Later he visited King Udaya and preached to him and his retinue, addressing the king by name. The queen-mother took offence at this and abused Gaṅgamāla, but the king begged him to forgive her. Gaṅgamāla returned to Gandhamādana, though urged by Udaya to stay in the royal park.<br>Ananda was Addhamāsaka, and Rāhulamātā was the queen.<br>The story was related by the Buddha to some lay-followers to en-courage them in their observance of the Uposatha (J.iii.444ff).<br>Gaṅgamāla is mentioned as an example of a man who realised the evils of taṇhā and renounced desire.

'gangātīriya thera':['An arahant. He was a householder named Datta of Sāvatthi. On discovering that he had, though unwittingly, committed incest with both his mother and sister, he was overcome with anguish and left the world. He adopted a course of austerity, dwelling in a hut of palm leaves on the bank of the Ganges, hence his name. For a whole year he kept silence; in the second year he spoke but once to a woman who, in filling his bowl, spilt the milk, wishing to discover if he were dumb. In the third year he became an arahant.<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a householder, and supplied drinks to monks (Thag.v.127-8; ThagA.i.248f).<br>It is said (ThagA.195f.; Thig.224f) that after Gangātiriya’s conception his mother was driven out of her house in the absence of her husband, her mother-in-law suspecting her of infidelity. The child was born in a travellers’ rest-house in Rājagaha, whither she had gone in search of her husband, and was taken away by a caravan leader who happened to see it when its mother was away bathing. Later the woman was carried away by a robber chief, by whom she had a daughter. One day, in a quarrel with her husband, she threw her daughter on the bed, wounding her on the head, and fearing her husband’s wrath she fled to Rājagaha, where she became a courtesan and later mistress of Gangātiriya, who was unaware of his relationship to her. Some time afterwards he took to wife the robber’s daughter as well. One day, while looking at the young wife’s head, the older one saw the wound, and as a result of her questions learnt the truth. Filled with dismay, both mother and daughter became nuns, and Gangātiriya left the world as mentioned above.<br>Gangātiriya is perhaps to be identified with Udakadāyaka of the Apadāna.

'garahadinna':['A resident of Sāvatthi and friend of Sirigutta. The latter was a follower of the Buddha, and the former of the Niganthas. Instigated by the Niganthas, Garahadinna constantly blamed his friend for his allegiance to the Buddha, until one day, in exasperation, Sirigutta invited the Niganthas to his house in order to prove that their claim to omniscience was false. To this end he had a ditch dug and filled with filth, ropes stretched longitudinally over the ditch, and the seats so arranged that the moment the Niganthas sat down they would be tipped over and flung into the ditch. The Niganthas arrived, and everything happened as Sirigutta had arranged. Garahadinna, filled with desire for revenge, hid his resentment and invited the Buddha and his disciples with the intention of humiliating them. He employed the same stratagem as his friend, except that the ditch was filled with glowing coals instead of with filth. The Buddha came, knowing all that had happened, and by an exercise of iddhi-power caused large lotus flowers to spring up from the bed of coals. Sitting thereon, he created an abundant supply of food and preached the Dhamma. Garahadinna, Sirigutta, and many others became sotāpannas (DhA.i.434f).<br>On this occasion was also preached the Khadirangāra Jātaka.

'garahita jātaka':['Once the Bodhisatta was a monkey in the Himalayas and, having been captured by a forester, was given to the king. The king grew fond of him, and the monkey learnt the ways of men. The king set him free, and when his fellows saw him they insisted on hearing from him how men lived. He told them of men’s greed for possessions, and how in each house there were two masters, one of them beardless, with long breasts and plaited hair. The monkeys, hearing of this folly, stopped their ears and went elsewhere, saying they could not bear to live in a place where they had heard such unseemly things! That place came thereafter to be called the Garahitapitthi-pāsāna.<br>The story was told in reference to a discontented monk. J.ii.184.'],
'garuḍā':['A class of mythical birds generally mentioned in company withNāgas (E.g., J.iv.181, 202).<br>They live in Simbali-groves (E.g., J.i.202) and are usually huge in size, sometimes one hundred and fifty leagues from wing to wing (J.iii.397). The flapping of their wings can raise a storm, known as the Garuda-wind (J.v.77). This wind can plunge a whole city in darkness and cause houses to fall through its violence (J.iii.188).<br>A Garula has strength great enough to carry off a whole banyan tree, tearing it up from its roots (J.vi.177). The Garulas are the eternal enemies of the Nāgas (J.ii.13; iii.103) and live in places, such as the Seruma Island (J.iii.187), where Nāgas are to be found. The greatest happiness of the Nāgas is to be free from the attacks of the Garulas (J.iv.463). A Garula’s plumage is so thick that a man - e.g., Natakuvera (J.iii.91) - could hide in it, unnoticed by the bird. Sometimes Garulas assume human form; two Garula kings are said to have played dice with kings ofBenares and to have fallen in love with their queens, whom they took to the Garula city - one of the queens beingSussondī (J.iii.187) and the otherKākātī (J.iii.91). In each case the queen, being found unfaithful to her Garula lover, was returned to her husband. The Garulas know the ālambāyana spell, which no Nāga can resist (J.vi.178, 184). It is said that in olden days the Garulas did not know how to seize Nāgas effectively; they caught them by the bead, and the Nāgas who had swallowed big stones were too heavy to be lifted from the ground; consequently the Garulas died of exhaustion in trying to carry them. Later the Garulas learnt this secret through the treachery of the ascetic Karambiya, as related in the Pandara Jātaka (J.vi.175f).<br>Garulas are mentioned as sometimes leading virtuous lives, keeping the fast and observing the precepts. One such was the Garula king mentioned in the Pandara Jātaka, and another, the son of Vināta, who visited the park of Dhanañjaya Koravya and gave a golden garland as present after hearing Vidhurapaṇḍita preach (J.vi.261f).<br>The Garula’s body was evidently considered to be specially formed for quick flight, for the ancient proto-type of the aeroplane was based on the Garula (DhA.iii.135). One of the five guards appointed by Sakka to protect Tāvatimsa from the Asuras was formed of Garulas (J.i.204).<br>The Bodhisatta (J.iii.187) andSāriputta (J.iii.400) were both, on different occasions, born as Garula kings. The Simbalī is the special tree of the Garula-world (Vsm.i.206). The Garula is often represented in art as a winged Man. (See Fergusson: Tree and Serpent Worship, pl.xxvi.1; xxviii.1. etc.; also Gründwedel: Buddhistische Kunst, pp.47-50).<br>The Garulas are sometimes called Supannas (Suvannas). VvA.9.'],

'gavampati':['1. Gavampati Thera.-An arahant. He was a son of a setthi in Benares, and one of the four lay companions of the Thera Yasa, who, when they heard of Yasa’s reṇunciation, imitated him and won arahant-ship. Later, Gavampati lived in the Añjanavana at Sāketa. One day, when the Buddha visited the Añjanavana, some of the monks accompanying him slept on the sandbanks of the Sarabhū. The river rose in the night and there was great dismay. The Buddha sent Gavampati to stem the flood, which he did by his iddhi-power. The water stopped afar off, looking like a mountain peak.<br>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a huntsman and seeing the Buddha offered him flowers. Later he built a parasol and a railing for the thūpa of Konāgamana. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a rich house holder possessed of many cattle. One day he saw an arahant eating his meal in the sun for lack of shade, and built for him a shelter and planted in front of it a sirīsa-tree. As a result he was born in the Cātummahārājika world, and his palace was known as Serissaka. (Vin.i.18f.; Thag.v.38; ThagA.i.103f; VvA.331f; DA.iii.814 gives a slightly different version of the origin of the Serissaka-vimāna).<br>Gavampati was the teacher of Mahānāga, son of Madhu-Vāsettha (ThagA.i.443). It is said that the Serissaka-vimāna, occupied by Gavampati, remained in the Cātummahārajika world even after he had left it. (D.ii.356f; DA.iii.814 says he went there because he found the ”climate” (utu) more agreeable. SNA.i.347 says it was because he, like Pindoḷa-bhāradvāja, loved his old haunts).<br>There Gavampati often spent his siesta and held conversations with Pāyāsi, who sent through him a message to the inhabitants of the earth, that they should profit by the example of him (Pāyāsi) and discriminate in the bestowal of their gifts.<br>The Dulvā mentions (Rockhill, p.149f) that after the Buddha’s death, when Mahā Kassapa wished to hold a Convocation of the chief monks, Punna was sent as a special messenger to summon Gavampati, who was then in the Serissaka-vimāna. But Gavampati did not attend, his death being imminent. Instead he sent his bowl and three robes as a gift to the Sangha.<br>Immediately afterwards he died, and Punna carried out his funeral rites.<br>Gavampati is evidently identical with Girinelapūjaka of the Apadāna (ii.457).<br>See also Gavampati Sutta below.<br>2. Gavampati.-The Sāsanavamsa (p.36f) speaks of a Thera by this name, at whose request the Buddha went to Sudhammapura in the Rāmañña country to establish his religion. In a previous life Gavampati was born of an egg laid by a Nāga maiden who had relations with a vijjā-dhara. The egg was hatched and a child was born, but it died at the age of ten and was reborn at Mithilā as Gavampati. He joined the Order at the age of seven and became an arahant. Later he visited Sudhamma-pura to preach to his mother, and there King Sīha asked him to invite the Buddha to his country.<br>Gavampati Sutta.-Preached by Gavampati at Sahajāti in the Ceti country. A number of the senior monks were talking of dukkha, and Gavampati tells them that he knows from the Buddha’s own self that whosoever understands dukkha knows all its aspects - its nature, its arising, its cessation and the path thereto.

'gāvha':['See Gahva ??.'],
'gayā':['One of the three Kassapa brothers, the Tebhātika-Jatilā (q.v.). On leaving the world with his brothers and becoming an ascetic, he gathered round him a company of two hundred other ascetics. They all lived at Gayāsīsa, hence his name (Gayāsīse pabbajito ti Gayā Kassapo nāma jāto). When Uruvela-Kassapa was converted, Gayā-Kassapa, with his followers, joined the Order, and at the conclusion of the Adittapariyāya Sutta they all became arahants (Vin.i.33f.; AA.i.165). Gayā-Kassapa is reported (Thag.v.345f) to have said that he used to bathe three times a day at Gayātittha, in order to wash away his sins during the festival of Gayāphaggu.<br>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a householder, and later became a forest-dwelling hermit. One day he saw the Buddha walking alone in the forest and offered him a kola-fruit (ThagA.i.417f).<br>He is evidently identical with Koladāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.379; see also ii.483.<br>gayā<br>1. Gayā.-A pond in which people bathed, that their sins might be washed away (J.v.388f). Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.145) it was a circular pond in which was a bathing ghat (mandavāpisanthānam tittham). But see below, Gayā (2).<br>2. Gayā.-A town in India. It lay on the road between the Bodhi-tree and Benares, and was three gāvutas from the Bodhi-tree and fifteen yojanas from Benares. (MA.i.387f; Fa Hien says the distance from the Bodhi-tree to Gayā, was twenty li, or about 3 1/3 miles). It was between the Bodhimanda and Gayā that the Buddha, on his way to Isipatana, met Upaka (Vin.i.8).<br>The Buddha stayed at Gayā on several occasions: once at Gayāsīsa (Vin.i.34; S.iv.19; A.iv.302), and also near the Tankitamañca (Sn. p.47; S.i.207, etc.), the residence of Suciloma.<br>Buddhaghosa says that Gayā was the name given both to the village and a bathing ghat near to it (also called Gayāpokkharanī). Dhamma-pāla (UdA.74, 75; cp. SNA.i.301), on the other hand, speaks of a Gayānadī and a Gayāpokkharanī as being two distinct bathing ghats, both commonly called Gayātittha, and both considered to possess the power of washing away sins. People went there, offered sacrifices to the gods, recited the Vedas, and immersed themselves in the water.<br>Elsewhere (ThagA.i.388f, 418; Thag.v.287) it is stated that every year, in the earlier half of the month of Phagguṇa (March), people held a bathing festival at the bathing ghat at Gayā, the festival being called Gayāphaggunī. It was at one of these festivals that Senaka Thera was converted by the Buddha. This explanation of Gayāphaggu is, perhaps, not quite correct, for, according to some, the river (Nerañjarā) which ran by Gayā was itself called Phaggu (Skt. Phaggu). E.g., Cunningham: AGI.524; Böthlinck and Roth’s Dict. s.v. Phalgu; Neumann (Majh. N. Trans.i.271) says that the village of Gayā itself was called Phaggu.<br>The town of Gayā is often called Brahmagayā to distinguish it from Buddhagayā (q.v.).'],
'gayā sutta':['Preached at Gayāsīsa. The Buddha describes to the monks some of the stages through which he passed before reaching Enlightenment.

'ghatīkāra':['One of the great Brahmā. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a potter of Vehalinga, looking after his blind parents. He was a very pious and devoted follower of the Buddha, ministering to him better than anyone else, and the Buddha accepted his invitation in preference to that of the king of Benares. It is said that when the Buddha was in need of anything he would go to Ghatīkāra’s house and take it, whether he were at home or not, so great was his confidence in Ghatīkāra’s piety. Once, when Ghatīkāra was absent, the people, at the Buddha’s suggestion, took away the thatch from his house to roof the hut of Tathāgata. For three months Ghatīkāra’s house remained open to the sky, but no rain fell on it, so great was his faith (Mil.223f). According to the Nalapāna Jātaka (J.i.172), no rain will ever fall on the site of Ghatīkāra’s’ house as long as this kappa lasts.<br>The Bodhisatta, who at the time of Ghatīkāra was a young brahmin named Jotipāla, was the friend of Ghatīkāra but had no faith in the Buddha, and Ghatīkāra, having failed to persuade him to visit the Buddha, in the end took him by force. Jotipāla was converted and joined the Order, but Ghatīkāra, as the only support of his parents, could not renounce the world.Kikī, king of Benares, having heard of his virtues from Kassapa Buddha, sent him five hundred cartloads of the choicest rice, etc., but Ghatīkāra returned the gifts, saying that he had plenty for himself (M.ii.46ff; S.i.35f; Bu.xxv.41; SnA.i.152).<br>After death, Ghatīkāra was born as a Mahābrahmā in theAvihā Brahma-world, and anAnāgāmī. He was evidently already a Sakadāgāmi before his death (see DhA.i.380), but he did not wish his attainments to be known (AA.i.44).<br>He provided the Buddha with the eight requisites of a monk when the Buddha, having left the world, decided to lead the life of a Bhikkhu (J.i.65; SnA.ii.382; BuA.236; VvA.314). The begging bowl, then provided by him, vanished when the Buddha was given a bowl of milk rice by Sujātā (J.i.69).<br>According to the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.35f; 60), Ghatīkāra visited the Buddha some time after the Enlightenment and the Buddha reminded him of their former friendship. Ghatīkāra, on that occasion, speaks of several others (besides Jotipāla) who had been his friends in Vehalinga - Upaka, Phalagaṇḍa, Pukkusāti,Bhaddiya, Khandadeva, Bāhuraggi andPingiya. They had listened to the Buddha’s teaching and, after death, were born in the Avihā-world, where he himself was. In this context the Buddha addresses him as Bhaggava.'],
'ghatīkāra sutta':['1. Ghatīkāra Sutta.-Preached during a tour in Kosala. The Buddha turned off the main road and, when be came to the spot which had once been Vehalinga, he smiled. Being asked by Ananda the reason for his smile, the Buddha related to him and to the monks the story of Ghatīkāra, the potter of Vehalinga, as given above (M.ii.45ff). It is said (MA.ii.717) that the Buddha wished to make known to the monks the great piety of Ghatīkāra. The sutta was repeated at a shrine near Todeyya, which was being worshipped by the people without their knowing its significance. The Buddha related the sutta and explained that the shrine was the thūpa of Kassapa Buddha. DhA.iii.251.<br>2.

'ghosa':['1. Ghosa.-The village in which Buddhaghosa was born. Sās.29.<br>2. Ghosa, Ghosaka.-A devaputta, Kotūhalaka, in a previous birth.

When the dog grew up, it used to accompany the herdsman on a visit to a Pacceka Buddha, who had meals in his house. Sometimes, when the herdsman was unable to go himself, he would send the dog to summon the Pacceka Buddha. The road led through a forest and the dog would bark aloud to frighten away the wild beasts. One day, when the Pacceka Buddha went elsewhere, the dog died of a broken heart and was reborn in Tāvatimsa as the god Ghosa or Ghosaka.<br>He was later reborn as Ghosaka-setthi.

'ghosaka':['(v.l. Ghosita°)<br>A setthi of Kosambī. Being born as the son of a courtesan, he is cast away on a refuse heap. A passer-by takes him home, but the Treasurer of Kosambī, knowing from an astrologer that the stars showed the birth of a very lucky boy, seeks him out and adopts him. A few days after, the Treasurer’s wife bears him a son, and he therefore plans to kill Ghosaka with the help of a slave woman, Kālī. All his attempts having failed, he promises a potter one thousand pieces if he will kill the boy. Ghosita is sent to the potter with a message; on the way he meets his foster-brother, and gives him the message, promising to win for him a game of marbles. The foster-brother goes to the potter and is killed. The Treasurer then sends Ghosaka to the superintendent of his hundred villages with a letter ordering that he be killed. The letter is fastened to the boy’s garment. On the way he stops for a meal at the house of a country-treasurer whose beautiful daughter falls in love with him. Discovering the letter, she substitutes another to the effect that Ghosaka should be married to her with great festivity and that a two-storied house should be built for them. The superintendent carries out these orders and the Treasurer falls ill on receiving the news. He is visited on his death-bed by Ghosaka and his wife, and while trying with his dying breath to say ”I do not give him my wealth,” by a slip of the tongue he says ”I do.” Ghosaka becomes a very pious man and is made the Treasurer of King Udena. Later he meetsSāmavatī, daughter of his friend Bhaddavatiya, adopts her as his daughter and, when the time comes, gives her in marriage to Udena.<br>In a past life Ghosaka had been Kotūhalaka of Addilarattha, but left there with his wife and child on account of great poverty. On the way he cast off the child on account of its being too heavy, but rescued it later in answer to his wife’s importunities. It was as a result of that act that he was cast away in this birth. Later he was born as a dog and then as Ghosakadevaputta (DhA.i.169ff; PsA.504ff) (q.v.).<br>Ghosaka had two colleagues in Kosambī, Kukkuta and Pavāriya. For a number of years they entertained five hundred ascetics from Himavā, during the rainy season, until one year the ascetics, hearing from a tree-sprite, who had been one of Anāthapindika’s labourers, of the arising of the Buddha, informed Ghosaka and his friends of their determination to see the Buddha at Sāvatthi. The ascetics went on ahead, followed by Ghosaka and the others, bearing all kinds of gifts. They all heard the Buddha preach, became sotāpannas, and invited the Buddha to Kosambī. On the invitation being accepted, they built residences for the Buddha and the monks at Kosambī, that built by Ghosaka being called Ghositārāma (DhA.i.203ff; AA.i.234f.; MA.i.539f; PsA.414, etc.).<br>Mitta (DhA.i.189) was the householder in charge of the refectory from which Ghosaka had food daily distributed to the needy, and Sumana was Ghosaka’s gardener (DhA.i.208).<br>Ghosaka is mentioned as an example of a man possessing puññiddhi.

At the conclusion of the talk he declared himself converted and wished to offer to Udena the daily allowance of five hundred kahāpaṇas which he regularly received from the king of Anga. Udena suggested that the money might be utilised to build an assembly-hall for the Order at Pātaliputta. The suggestion was agreed to and the assembly-hall, when built, was called Ghotamukhī (M.ii.157ff).<br>The Commentary (MA.ii.786f) adds that Ghotamukha held the view that one should seek self-glorification, even by the slaughter of one’s parents, and that he was the only person born in heaven, in spite of having held that view. After his birth in heaven, having discovered the cause of his good fortune, be came to earth in disguise and, after revealing his identity to his only remaining sister, told her where his treasures were hidden and instructed her to spend some of the money on renovating an old refectory which the monks were trying to restore.'],

Udena describes to him the four types of individuals - those who torture themselves, those who torture others, those who torture both and those who torture neither, the last being those who live beyond appetites, consummate, unfevered and blissful. They want none of the things after which men hanker, but discarding them all go forth to homelessness. Ghotamukha admits that such are Righteous Recluses. M.ii.157ff'],

When the weather cleared the vultures returned to their haunts, and decided to give the merchant whatever finery and jewellery they might find in their wanderings. These they dropped in the merchant’s garden. The king, hearing of their depredations, set traps and caught a vulture, who confessed the truth, which was corroborated by the merchant. The vulture was set free and the goods were returned to their owners.<br>Ananda was the king, and Sāriputta the merchant.<br>The story was told in reference to a monk who was charged with having supported his poor parents.

'giñjakāvasatha':['A brick hall at Nādikā (Ñātikā). The Buddha stayed there on various occasions during his visits to Nādikā. It was during one of these visits that Ambapāli presented her park to the Buddha and the Order (Vin.i.232).<br>In the Giñjakāvasatha the Buddha preached the Cūlagosinga Sutta (M.i.205), the Janavasabha Sutta (D.ii.200) and several discourses on marana-sati (E.g., A.iii.303f; 306f; 391f; iv.320f); also the sermons to the Elder Sandha of the Kaccānagotta (A.v.322f) and the Elder Kaccāyana (S.ii.153f; see also S.ii.74; iv.90).<br>Both in the Janavasabha Sutta and the Giñjakāvasatha Sutta (S.v.356f), which was preached at the same place, the Buddha is represented as having answered questions regarding the destiny and the rebirth of several residents of Nādikā. Does this perhaps mean that the people of Nādikā were more interested in this problem than the people of other places? It was by way of finding a permanent solution to these questions that the Buddha preached to Ananda at Giñjakāvasatha the Dhammā-dāsa (Mirror of Truth) on his last visit to Nādikā, as described in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.91ff; see also S.v.357).<br>The Commentaries (E.g., MA.i.424) state that once the Buddha arrived at Nādikā while travelling in the Vajji country, and the people there built for him a residence entirely made of bricks (giñjakā), hence its name. Later, residences were also built for the monks, complete with all requirements. The bricks were evidently a special architectural feature, and this con-firms the belief that buildings were generally of wood. The ”Brick Hall” was, however, not designed for the Buddha and his monks alone, for we find mention of members of other sects staying there - e.g., the Paribbājaka Sabhiya Kaccāna (S.iv.401). The building was probably a resting place for all travellers.'],

'giraggasamajjā':['A festival held from time to time (kālānukālam) in Rājagaha. (Perhaps elsewhere as well. The BuA. p.102 says it was an annual festival held all over Jambudīpa and was as old as Dīpankara Buddha; see also J.iii.538). It was held in the open air in the afternoon and was attended by all people of all grades of society from Anga and Magadha. Special seats were prepared for the more eminent of the audience, and the festivities seem to have consisted chiefly of nautch dances (SNA.i.326). According to the Vinaya accounts (Vin.ii.107f, 150; iv.85, 267) there were also singing and music, and the festival was attended not only by laymen, but also by members of religious orders, for otherwise it is unlikely that the Sattarasavaggiyas and the Chabbaggiyas would have been there. Food was provided as well as amusements. Buddhaghosa (Sp.iv.831) explains the name of the festival thus: giraggasamajjo ti girimhi aggasamajjo girissa vā aggadese sammajo, and tells us that it was announced for seven days before its commencement, and was held on level ground under a shadow of a hill and outside the city. Perhaps it was originally a pagan religious festival, a survival of old exogamic communistic dancing (See Dial.i.7, n.4; VT.iii.71, n.3).<br>It was at a Giraggasamajjā that Sāriputta and Moggallāna decided to leave the world (DhA.i.73f.; AA.i.89, etc.).<br>The Sanskrit equivalent is Girivaggu-samāgama.

The most costly offerings given during this feast to any monk - namely, a pair of garments - fell to the lot of a young novice, Lonagirivāsī Tissa, in spite of the efforts of the king’s ministers to get them into the hands of the older monks. It was because the novice had practised the sārānīya-dhammā (DA.ii.535; AA.ii.653f; MA.i.545f).<br>The festival was probably connected with the Giribhaṇḍa-vihāra, in which case that was the reason for the name.'],

For details see the Mahilāmukha Jātaka.<br>3. Godha Jātaka (No.325).-The story of the past is very similar to No.1 above, except that there is only mention of one ascetic and he is a hypocrite. The young lizard threatened to expose the ascetic’s hypocrisy and compelled him to leave the hermitage. The story was related in reference to a monk who was a cheat and a rogue (J.iii.84f).<br>Cf. the Kuhakabrāhmana Vatthu (DhA.iv.154f.).<br>4. Godha Jātaka (No.333).-A prince and his wife, returning after a long journey, were greatly distressed by hunger, and some hunters, seeing them, gave them a roasted lizard. The wife carried it in her hand, hanging it from a creeper. Arriving at a lake, they sat down at the foot of a tree, and while his wife was away fetching water the prince ate the whole lizard. When his wife came back, he told her that the lizard had run away, leaving only the tail in his hand. Later, the prince became king, but his wife, though appointed queen consort, received no real honour. The Bodhisatta, who was the king’s minister, wishing to see justice done to the queen, contrived that the king should be reminded of his ingratitude by allusion being made to the incident of the roast lizard. The king thereupon realised his neglect of his dutiful wife, and conferred on her supreme power.<br>The story was told in reference to a couple who had been given a roast lizard, when returning from a journey undertaken to collect debts. The husband ate the whole lizard when his wife was away. She said nothing and drank some water to appease her hunger, but when they visited the Buddha, and be asked her if her husband were good and affectionate, she replied in the negative. The Buddha then told her the story of the past. J.iii.106f.; cf.Succaja Jātaka.'],

Six times this happened and then he decided to commit suicide by cutting his throat.Māra saw this and reported it to the Buddha, but when the Buddha arrived it was too late and Godhika lay ”supine on his couch with his shoulders twisted around.” The Buddha, however, declared that Godhika had attained Nibbāna.

Elsewhere (p.269), the Tīkā speaks of a Gokannatittha in the neighbourhood of the estuary of the Mahākandara-nadī, and the Cūlavamsa (lxxi.18) mentions Gokanna as the last of a series of fords in Rohana, important from a strategic point of view, along the Mahā-vālkaugangā, from ”Sarogāmatittha to Gokanna.” In another passage (Cv.xli.79), Gokanna(ka) is spoken of as mahannava (the ocean). These facts support Geiger’s conjecture (Cv.

He fled, therefore, to Kālavāpi and, on various occasions, offered battle to the forces of Parakkamabāhu, but everywhere he was defeated, the worst reverse being at Nīlagala by the general Māyāgeha.

Controversy exists with regard to many of the matters mentioned; for discussion of the varying views regarding these, reference should be made to the works of Oldenberg, Rhys Davids (both Professor and Mrs. Rhys Davids), Kern, E. J. Thomas and other scholars. Further particulars of persons and places mentioned can be obtained by reference to the articles under the respective names.<br>He was a Sākiyan (the Sākiyans were evidently subjects of the Kosala king; the Buddha calls himself a Kosalan, M.ii.124), son of Suddhodana (all Pāli Commentaries and Sanskrit works represent the Buddha as the son of a king, descendant of a long line of famous ancestors), chief ruler of Kapilavatthu, and of Mahā Māyā, Suddhodana’s chief consort, and he belonged to the Gotama-gotta. Before his conception he was in the Tusita heaven, waiting for the due time for his birth in his last existence. Then, having made the ”five investigations” (pañcavilolcanāni) (see Buddha), he took leave of his companions and descended to earth. (According to the Lalitavistara he appointed the Bodhisatta Maitreya as king of Tusita in his place). Many wondrous and marvellous events attended his conception and birth. (Given in the Acchariyabbhutadhamma Sutta, M.iii.118f; also D.ii.12f. A more detailed account is found in J.i.47ff; both the Lai. and the Mtu.ii.14ff differ as to the details given here of the conception and the birth).<br>The conception takes place on the full-moon day of āsāḷha, with the moon in Uttarāsāḷha, and Maya has no relations with her husband. She has a marvellous dream in which the Bodhisatta, as a white elephant, enters her womb through her side. When the dream is mentioned to the brahmins, they foretell the birth of a son who will be either a universal monarch or a Buddha. An earthquake takes place and thirty-two signs appear, presaging the birth of a great being. The first of these signs is a boundless, great light, flooding every corner of the ten thousand worlds; everyone beholds its glory, even the fires in all hells being extinguished. Ten months after the conception, in the month of Visākha, Māyā wishes to visit her parents in Devadaha. On the way thither from Kapilavatthu she passes the beautiful Lumbini grove, in which she desires to wander; she goes to a great sāla-tree and seizes a branch in her hand; labour pains start immediately, and, when the courtiers retire, having drawn a curtain round her, even while standing, she is delivered of the child. It is the day of the full moon of Visākha; four Mahābrahmas receive the babe in a golden net, and streams of water descend from the sky to wash him. The boy stands on the earth, takes seven steps north-wards and utters his lion-roar, ”I am the chief in the world.” On the same day seven other beings were born: the Bodhi-tree, Rāhula’s mother (Rāhulamātā, his future wife), the four Treasure-Troves (described at DA.i.284), his elephant, his horse Kanthaka, his charioteer Channa, and Kāludāyī. The babe is escorted back to Kapilavatthu on the day of his birth and his mother dies seven days later.<br>The isi Asita (or Kāladevala), meditating in the Himālaya, learns from the Tāvatimsa gods of the birth of the Buddha, visits Suddhodana the same day and sees the boy, whom they both worship. Asita weeps for sorrow that he will not live to see the boy’s Buddhahood, but he instructs his nephew Nālaka (v.l. Naradatta) to prepare himself for that great day. On the fifth day after the birth is the ceremony of name-giving. One hundred and eight brahmins are invited to the festival at the palace; eight of them - Rāma, Dhaja, Lakkhana, Manti, Kondañña, Bhoja, Suyāma and Sudatta - are interpreters of bodily marks, and all except Kondañña prophesy two possibilities for the boy; but Kondañña, the youngest, says, quite decisively, that he will be a Buddha. The name given to the boy at this ceremony is not actually mentioned, but from other passages it is inferred that it was Siddhattha (q.v.).<br>Among other incidents recounted of the Buddha’s boyhood is that of his attaining the first jhāna under a jambu-tree. One day he is taken to the state ploughing of the king where Suddhodana himself, with his golden plough, ploughs with the farmers. The nurses, attracted by the festivities, leave the child under a jambu-tree. They return to find him seated, cross-legged, in a trance, the shadow of the tree remaining still, in order to protect him. The king is informed and, for the second time, does reverence to his son. J.i.57f; MA.i.466f; the incident is alluded to in the Mahā Saccaka Sutta (M.i.246); the corresponding incident recounted in Mtu. (ii.45f.) takes place in a park, and the, details differ completely. The Lai. has two versions, one in prose and one in verse and both resemble the Mtu.; but in these the Buddha is represented as being much older. The Divy (391) and the Tibetan versions (e.g., Rockhill, p.22) put the incident very much later in the Buddha’s life. Other incidents are given in Lai. and Mtu.<br>The Bodhisatta is reported to have lived in the household for twenty-nine years a life of great luxury and excessive ease, surrounded by all imaginable comforts. He owns three palaces - Ramma, Suramma and Subha - for the three seasons. Mention is made of his luxurious life in A.i.145; also in M.i.504; further details are given in AA.i.378f.; J.i.58. See also Mtu.ii.115; cf. Vin.i.15; D.ii.21.<br>When the Bodhisatta is sixteen years old, Suddhodana sends messengers to the Sākyans asking that his son be allowed to seek a wife from among their daughters; but the Sākyans are reluctant to send them, for, they say, though the young man is hand-some, he knows no art; how, then, can he support a wife? When this is reported to the prince, he summons an assembly of the Sākyans and performs various feats, chief of these being twelve feats with a bow which needs the strength of one thousand men. (The feats with the bow are described in the Sarabhaṅga Jātaka, J.v.129f ). The Sākyans are so impressed that each sends him a daughter, the total number so sent being forty thousand. The Bodhisatta appoints as his chief wife the daughter of Suppabuddha, who, later, comes to be called Rāhulamātā. She is known under various names: Bhaddakaccā (or Kaccānā), Yasodharā. Bimbā, Bimbasundarī and Gopā. For a discussion see Rāhulamātā.<br>According to the generally accepted account, Gotama is twenty-nine when the incidents occur which lead to final reṇunciation. Following the prophecy of the eight brahmins, his father had taken every precaution that his son should see no sign of old age, sickness or death. But the gods decide that the time is come for the Enlightenment, and instil into Gotama’s heart a desire to go into the park. On the way, the gods put before him a man showing signs of extreme age, and the Bodhisatta returns, filled with desire for reṇunciation. The king, learning this, surrounds him with even greater attractions, but on two other days Gotama goes to the park and the gods put before him a sick man and a corpse. (According to some accounts, e.g. that of the Dīghabhānakas, the four omens were all seen on the same day, J.i.59)<br>On the full-moon day of āsāḷha, the day appointed for the Great Renunciation, Gotama sees a monk and hears from his charioteer praise of the ascetic life. Feeling very happy, he goes to the park to enjoy himself. Sakka sends Vissakamma himself to bathe and adorn him, and as Gotama returns to the city in all his majesty, he receives news of the birth of his son. Foreseeing in this news a bond, he decides to call the babe Rāhula (q.v.). Kisā Gotamī (q.v.) sees Gotama on the way to the palace and, filled with longing for him, sings to him a song containing the word nibbuta. The significance of the word (=extinguished, at peace) thrills him, and he sends to Kisā his priceless gold necklace which she, however, accepts as a token of love. Gotama enters the palace and sleeps. He wakes in the middle of the night to find his female musicians sleeping in attitudes which fill him with disgust and with loathing for the worldly life, and he decides to leave it. (In some versions the Renunciation takes place seven days after the birth of Rāhula, J.i.62). He orders Channa to saddle Kanthaka, and enters his wife’s room for a last look at her and their son.<br>He leaves the city on his horse Kanthaka, with Channa clinging to its tail. The devas muffle the sound of the horse’s hoofs and of his neighing and open the city gates for Gotama to pass. Māra appears before Gotama and seeks to stay him with a promise that he shall be universal monarch within seven days. On his offer being refused, Māra threatens to shadow him always. Outside the city, at the spot where later was erected the Kanthakanivattana-cetiya, Gotama turns his horse round to take a last look at Kapilavatthu. It is said that the earth actually turned, to make it easy for him to do so. Then, accompanied by the gods, he rides thirty leagues through three kingdoms - those of the Sākyans, the Koliyans and the Mallas - and his horse crosses the river Anomā in one leap. On the other side, he gives all his ornaments to Channa, and with his sword cuts off hair and beard, throwing them up into the air, where Sakka takes them and enshrines them in the Cūlāmani-cetiya in Tāvatimsa. The Brahmā Ghatikāra offers Gotama the eight requisites of a monk, which he accepts and adopts. He then sends Channa and Kanthaka back to his father, but Kanthaka, broken-hearted, dies on the spot and is reborn as Kanthaka-devaputta.<br>The account given here is taken mainly from the Nidānakathā (J.i.59ff) and evidently embodies later tradition; cp. D.ii.21ff. From passages found in the Pitakas (e.g., A.i.145; M.i.163, 240; M.ii.212f.) it would appear that the events leading up to the Renunciation were not so dramatic as given here, the process being more gradual. I do not, however, agree with Thomas (op. cit., 58) that, according to these accounts, the Bodhisatta left the world when ”quite a boy.” I think the word dahara is used merely to indicate ”the prime of youth,” and not necessarily ”boyhood.” The description of the Renunciation in the Lal. is very much more elaborate and adds numerous incidents, no account of which is found in the Pāli.<br>From Anomā the Bodhisatta goes to the mango-grove of Anupiya, and after spending seven days there walks to Rājagaha (a distance of thirty leagues) in one day, and there starts his alms rounds. Bimbisāra’s men, noticing him, report the matter to the king, who sends messengers to enquire who this ascetic is. The men follow Gotama to the foot of the Pandavapabbata, where he eats his meal, and they then go and report to the king. Bimbisāra visits Gotama, and, pleased with his hearing, offers him the sovereignty. On learning the nature of Gotama’s quest, he wins from him a promise to visit Rājagaha first after the Enlightenment.<br>This incident is also mentioned in the Pabbajjā Sutta (SN.vv.405-24), but there it is the king who first sees Gotama. It is significant that, when asked his identity, Gotama does not say he is a king’s son. The Pali version of tile sutta contains nothing of Gotama’s promise to visit Rājagaha, but the Mtu. version (ii.198-200), which places the visit later, has two verses, one of which contains the request and the other the acceptance; and the SNA. (ii.385f.), too, mentions the promise and tells that Bimbisāra was informed of the prophecy concerning Gotama. There is another version of the Mtu. (ii.117-20) which says that Gotama went straight to Vaisāli after leaving home, joining Ālāra, and later visited Uddaka at Rājagaha. Here no mention is made of Bimbisāra. We are told in the Mhv. (ii.25ff) that Bimbisāra and Gotama (Siddhattha) had been playmates, Bimbisāra being the younger by five years. Bimbisāra’s father (Bhātī) and Suddhodana were friends.<br>Journeying from Rājagaha, Gotama in due course becomes a disciple of Ālāra-Kālāma. Having learnt and practised all that Ālāra has to teach, he finds it unsatisfying and joins Uddaka-Rāmaputta; but Uddaka’s doctrine leaves him still unconvinced and he abandons it. He then goes to Senānīgāma in Uruvelā and there, during six years, practises all manner of severe austerities, such as no man had previously undertaken. Once he falls fainting and a deva informs Suddhodana that Gotama is dead. But Suddhodana, relying on the prophecy of Kāladevala, refuses to believe the news. Gotama’s mother, now born as a devaputta in Tāvatimsa, comes to him to encourage him. At Uruvelā, the Pañcavaggiya monks are his companions, but now, having realised the folly of extreme asceticism, he decides to abandon it, and starts again to take normal food; thereupon the Pañcavaggiyas, disappointed, leave him and go to Isipatana.<br>J.i.66f. The Therīgāthā Commentary (p.2) mentions another teacher of Gotama, named Bhaggava, whom Gotama visited before Ālāra. Lal. (330 \[264\]) contains a very elaborate account of Gotama’s visits to teachers; he goes first to two brahmin women, Sākī and Padmā, then to Raivata and Rajaka, son of Trimandika, and finally (as far as this chapter is concerned) to Ālāra at Vaisāli. A poem containing an account of the meeting of Gotama with Bimbisāra is inserted into this account. The next chapter tells of Uddaka. An account of Gotama’s visits to teachers and of the details of his austerities is also given in the Mahā Saccaka Sutta, already referred to (M.i.240ff); the Mahā Sīhanāda Sutta (M.i.77ff) contains a long and detailed account of his extreme asceticisms. See also M.i.163ff; ii.93f.<br>Gotama’s desire for normal food is satisfied by an offering brought by Sujātā to the Ajapāla banyan tree under which he is seated. She had made a vow to the tree, and her wish having been granted, she takes her slave-girl, Punnā, and goes to the tree prepared to fulfil her promise. They take Gotama to be the Tree-god, come in person to accept her offering of milk-rice; the offering is made in a golden bowl and he takes it joyfully. Five dreams he had the night before convince Gotama that he will that day become the Buddha. (The dreams are, recounted in A.iii.240 and in Mtu.ii.136f). It is the full-moon day of Visākha; he bathes at Suppatittha in the Nerañjarā, eats the food and launches the bowl up stream, where it sinks to the abode of the Nāga king, Kāla (Mahākāla).<br>Gotama spends the rest of the day in a sāla-grove and, in the evening, goes to the foot of the Bodhi-tree, accompanied by various divinities; there the grass-cutter Sotthiya gives him eight handfuls of grass; these, after investigation, Gotama spreads on the eastern side of the tree, where it becomes a seat fourteen hands long, on which he sits cross-legged, determined not to rise before attaining Enlightenment.<br>J.i.69. The Pitakas know nothing of Sujātā’s offering or of Sotthiya’s gift. Lal. (334-7 \[267-70\]) mentions ten girls in all who provide him with food during his austerities. Divy (392) mentions two, Nandā and Nandabalā.<br>Māra, lord of the world of passion, is determined to prevent this fulfilment, and attacks Gotama with all the strength at his command. His army extends twelve leagues to the front, right, and left of him, to the end of the Cakkavāla behind him, and nine leagues into the sky above him. Māra himself carries numerous weapons and rides the elephant Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height. At the sight of him all the divinities gathered at the Bodhi-tree to do honour to Gotama - the great Brahmā, Sakka, the Nāga-king Mahākāla - disappear in a flash, and Gotama is left alone with the ten pāramī, long practised by him, as his sole protection. All Māra’s attempts to frighten him by means of storms and terrifying apparitions fail, and, in the end, Māra hurls at him the Cakkāvudha. It remains as a canopy poised over Gotama. The very earth bears witness to Gotama’s fitness to be the Enlightened One, and Girimekhala kneels before him. Māra is vanquished and flees headlong with his vast army. The various divinities who had fled at the approach of Māra now return to Gotama and exult in his triumph.<br>The whole story of the contest with Māra is, obviously, a mythological development. It is significant that in the Majjhima passages referred to earlier there is no mention of Māra, of a temptation, or even of a Bodhi-tree; but see D.ii.4 and Thomas (op. cit., n.1). According to the Kālingabodhi Jātaka, which, very probably, embodies an old tradition, the bodhi-tree was worshipped even in the Buddha’s life-time. The Māra legend is, however, to be found in the Canonical Padhāna Sutta of the Sutta Nipāta. This perhaps contains the first suggestion of the legend. For a discussion see Māra.<br>Gotama spends that night in deep meditation. In the first watch he gains remembrance of his former existences; in the middle watch he attains the divine eye (dibbacakkhu); in the last watch he revolves in his mind the Chain of Causation (paticcasamuppāda). As he masters this, the earth trembles and, with the dawn, comes Enlightenment. He is now the supreme Buddha, and he breaks forth into a paean of joy (udāna).<br>There is great doubt as to which were these Udāna verses. The Nidānakathā and the Commentaries generally quote two verses (153, 154) included in the Dhammapada collection (anekajāti samsāram, etc.). The Vinaya (i.2) quotes three different verses (as does also DhsA.17), and says that one verse was repeated at the end of each watch, all the watches being occupied with meditation on the paticcasamuppāda. Mtu. (ii.286) gives a completely different Udāna, and in another place (ii.416) mentions a different verse as the first Udāna. The Tibetan Vinaya is, again, quite different (Rockhill, p.33). For a discussion see Thomas, op. cit., 75ff.<br>For the first week the Buddha remains under the Bodhi-tree, meditating on the Paticcasamuppāda; the second week he spends at the Ajapālanigrodha, where the ”Huhuhka” Brahmin accosts him (Mara now comes again and asks the Buddha to die at once; D.ii.112) and where Mara’s daughters, Tanhā, Aratī and Rāgā, appear before the Buddha and make a last attempt to shake his resolution (J.i.78; S.i.124; Lal.490 (378)); the third week he spends under the hood of the nāga-king Mucalinda (Vin.i.3); the fourth week is spent in meditation under the Rājāyatana tree*; at the end of this period takes place the conversion of Tapussa and Bhallika. They take refuge in the Buddha and the Dhamma, though the Buddha does not give them any instruction.<br>*This is the Vinaya account (Vin.i.1ff); but the Jātaka (i.77ff, extends this period to seven weeks, the additional weeks being inserted between the first and second. The Buddha spends one week each at the Animisa-cetiya, the Ratanacankama and the Ratanaghara, and this last is where he thinks out the Abhidhamma Pitaka.<br>Doubts now assail the Buddha as to whether he shall proclaim to the world his doctrine, so recondite, so hard to understand. The Brahma Sahampati (according to J.i.81, with the gods of the thousand worlds, including Sakka, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimmita, Vasavatti, etc.) appears before him and assures him there are many prepared to listen to him and to profit by his teaching, and so entreats him to teach the Dhamma. The Buddha accedes to his request and, after consideration, decides to teach the Dhamma first to the Pañcavaggiyas at Isipatana. On the way to Benares he meets the ājīvaka Upaka and tells him that he (the Buddha) is Jina. On his arrival at Isipatana the Pañcavaggiyas are, at first, reluctant to acknowledge his claim to be the Tathāgata, but they let themselves be won over and, on the full-moon day of āsāḷha, the Buddha preaches to them the sermon which came to be known as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. (Vin.i.4ff; M.i.118ff; cp. D.ii.36ff. Regarding the claim of this sutta to be the Buddha’s first sermon, see Thomas, op. cit., p.86; see also Pañcavaggiyā). At the end of the sermon Kondañña becomes a sotāpanna and they all become monks.<br>This sermon is followed five days later by the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta, at the conclusion of which all five become arahants. The following day the Buddha meets Yasa, whom he converts. Yasa’s father, who comes seeking him, is the first to take the threefold formula of Refuge.<br>Yasa becomes an arahant and is ordained. The Buddha accepts a meal at his house, and Yasa’s mother and one of his former wives are the first two lay-women to become the Buddha’s disciples. Then four friends of Yasa and, afterwards, fifty more, enter the Order and become arahants. There are now sixty arahants besides the Buddha, and they are sent in different directions to preach the Dhamma. They return with many candidates for admission to the Order, and the Buddha, who up till now had ordained men with the ”ehi bhikkhu” formula, now allows the monks themselves to perform the ceremony of ordination (Vin.i.15ff; J.i.81f).<br>After spending the rainy season at Benares (about this time Māra twice tries to tempt the Buddha, once after he had sent the disciples out to preach and once after the Retreat, S.i.105, 111; Vin.i.21, 22), the Buddha returns to Senānigāma in Uruvela, on the way converting and ordaining the thirty Bhaddavaggiyā. At Uruvela, after a long and protracted exercise of magical powers, consisting in all of three thousand five hundred miracles, the Buddha wins over the three Kassapa brothers, the Tebhātika Jatilā, with their thousand followers, and ordains them. They become arahants after listening to the ādittapariyāya Sutta preached at Gayāsīsa; with these followers he visits Rājagaha, where King Seniya Bimbisāra comes to see him at the Latthivanuyyāna. The following day the Buddha and the monks visit the palace, preceded by Sakka disguised as a youth and singing the praises of the Buddha. After the meal, the king gifts Veluvana to the Buddha and the Order. The Buddha stays for two months at Rājagaha (BuA.4), and it is during this time that Sāriputta and Moggallāna join the Order, through the instrumentality of Assaji (Vin.i.23ff). It was probably during this year, at the beginning of the rainy season, that the Buddha visited Vesāli at the request of the Licchavis, conveyed through Mahāli. The city was suffering from pestilence and famine. The Buddha went, preached the Ratana Sutta and dispelled all dangers (DhA.iii.436ff).<br>The number of converts now rapidly increases and the people of Magadha, alarmed by the prospect of childlessness, widow-hood, etc., blame the Buddha and his monks. The Buddha, however, refutes their charges (Vin.i.42f).<br>The account of the first twenty years of the Buddha’s ministry is summarised from various sources, chiefly from Thomas’s admirable account in his Life and Legend of the Buddha (pp.97ff). The necessary references are to be found under the names mentioned.<br>On the full-moon day of Phagguṇa (February-March) the Buddha, accompanied by twenty thousand monks, sets out for Kapilavatthu at the express request of his father, conveyed through Kāludāyī. (This visit is not mentioned in the Canon; but see Thag.527-36; AA.i.107, 167; J.i.87; DhA.i.96f; ThagA.i.997ff).<br>By slow stages he arrives at the city, where he stays at the Nigrodhārāma, and, in order to convince his proud kinsmen of his power, performs the Yamakapātihārjya and then relates the Vessantara Jātaka. The next day, receiving no invitation to a meal, the Buddha begs in the streets of the city; this deeply grieves Suddhodana, but later, learning that it is the custom of all Buddhas, he becomes a sotāpanna and conducts the Buddha and his monks to meal at the palace. There all the women of the palace, excepting only Rāhulamātā, come and do reverence to the Buddha. Mahā Pajāpatī becomes a sotāpanna and Suddhodana a sakadāgāmi. The Buddha visits Rāhulamātā in her own apartments and utters her praises in the Candakinnara Jātaka. The following day the Buddha persuades his half-brother, Nanda, to come to the monastery, where he ordains him and, on the seventh day, he does the same with Rāhula. This is too great a blow for Suddhodana, and at his request the Buddha rules that no person shall be ordained without the consent of his parents. The next day the Buddha preaches to Suddhodana, who becomes an anāgāmī. During the Buddha’s visit to Kapilavatthu, eighty thousand Sākyans join the Order, one from each family. With these he returns to Rājagaha, stopping on the way at Anupiya, where Anuruddha, Bhaddiya, Ananda, Bhagu, Kimbila and Devadatta, together with their barber, Upāli, visit him and seek ordination.<br>On his return to Rājagaha the Buddha resides in the Sītavana. (J.i.92, the story is also told in the Vinaya ii.154, but no date is indicated). There Sudatta, later known as Anāthapindika, visits him, is converted, and invites him to Sāvatthi. The Buddha accepts the invitation and journeys through Vesāli to Sāvatthi, there to pass the rainy season. (Vin.ii.158; but see BuA.3, where the Buddha is mentioned as having spent the vassa in Rājagaha). Anāthapindika gifts Jetavana, provided with every necessity, for the residence of the Buddha and his monks. Probably to this period belongs the conversion of Migāra, father-in-law of Visākhā, and the construction, by Visākhā, of the Pubbārāma at Sāvatthi. The vassa of the fourth year the Buddha spends at Veluvana, where he converts Uggasena. (DhA.iv.59f). In the fifth year Suddhodana dies, having realised arahant-ship, and the Buddha flies through the air, from the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli where he was staying, to preach to his father on his death-bed. According to one account it is at this time that the quarrel breaks out between the Sākyans and the Koliyans regarding the irrigation of the river Rohinī. (AA.i.186; SNA.i.357; ThigA.141; details of the quarrel are given in J.v.412ff). The Buddha persuades them to make peace, and takes up his abode in the Nigrodhārāma. Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī, with other Sākiyan women, visits him there and asks that women may be allowed to join the Order. Three times the request is made, three times refused, the Buddha then returning to Vesāli. The women cut off their hair, don yellow robes and follow him thither. Ananda intercedes on their behalf and their request is granted. (Vin.ii.253ff; A.iv.274f.; for details see Mahā Pajāpati).<br>In the sixth year the Buddha again performs the Yamakapātihāriya, this time at the foot of the Gandamba tree in Sāvatthi. Prior to this, the Buddha had forbidden any display of magic powers, but makes an exception in his own case (DhA.iii.199f.; J.iv.265, etc.).<br>He spends the vassa at Mankulapabbata. After the performance of the miracle he follows the custom of all Buddhas and ascends to Tāvatimsa in three strides to preach the Abhidhamma to his mother who is born there as a deva, and there he keeps the seventh vassa. The multitude, gathered at Sāvatthi at the Yamakapātihāriya, refuse to go away until they have seen him. For three months, therefore, Moggallāna expounds to them the Dhamma, while Culla Anāthapindika provides them with food. During the preaching of the Abhidhamma, Sāriputta visits the Buddha daily and learns from him all that has been recited the previous day. At the end of the vassa, the Buddha descends a jewelled staircase and comes to earth at Sankassa, thirty leagues from Sāvatthi. (For details see Devorohana). It was about this time, when the Buddha’s fame was at its height, that the notorious Ciñcā-mānavikā was persuaded by members of some hostile sect to bring a vile accusation against the Buddha. A similar story, told in connection with a paribbājikā named Sundarī, probably refers to a later date.<br>The eighth year the Buddha spends in the country of the Bhaggas and there, while residing in Bhesakalāvana near Sumsumāragiri, he meets Nakulapitā and his wife, who had been his parents in five hundred former births (A.A.i.217).<br>The same is told of another old couple in Sāketa. See the Sāketa Jātaka. The Buddha evidently stayed again at Sumsumāragiri many years later. It was during his second visit that Bodhirājakumāra (q.v.) invited him to a meal at his new palace in order that the Buddha might consecrate the building by his presence.<br>In the ninth year the Buddha is at Kosambī. While on a visit to the Kuru country he is offered in marriage Māgandiyā, the beautiful daughter of the brahmin Māgandiyā. The refusal of the offer, accompanied by insulting remarks about physical beauty, arouses the enmity of Māgandiyā who, thenceforward, cherishes hatred against the Buddha.<br>SN., pp.163ff; SNA.ii.542ff; DhA.i.199ff Thomas (op. cit., 109) assigns the Māgandiyā incident to the ninth year. I am not sure if this is correct, for the Commentaries say the Buddha was then living at Sāvatthi.<br>In the tenth year there arises among the monks at Kosambī a schism which threatens the very existence of the Order. The Buddha, failing in his attempts to reconcile the disputants, retires in disgust to the Pārileyyaka forest, passing on his way through Bālakalonakāragāma and Pācīnavamsadāya. In the forest he is protected and waited upon by a friendly elephant who has left the herd. The Buddha spends the rainy season there and returns to Sāvatthi. By this time the Kosambī monks have recovered their senses and ask the Buddha’s pardon. This is granted and the dispute settled. (Vin.i.337ff; J.iii.486f; DhA.i.44ff; but see Ud.iv.5; s.v. Pārileyyaka).<br>In the eleventh year the Buddha resides at the brahmin village of Ekanālā and converts Kasi-Bhāradvāja (SN., p.12f.; S.i.172f). The twelfth year he spends at Verañjā, keeping the vassa there at the request of the brahmin Verañja. But Verañja forgets his obligations; there is a famine, and five hundred horse-merchants supply the monks with food. Moggallāna’s offer to obtain food by means of magic power is discouraged (Vin.iii.1ff; J.iii.494f; DhA.ii.153). The thirteenth Retreat is kept at Cālikapabbata, where Meghiya is the Buddha’s personal attendant (A.iv.354; Ud.iv.1). The fourteenth year is spent at Sāvatthi, and there Rāhula receives the upasampadā ordination.<br>In the fifteenth year the Buddha revisits Kapilavatthu, and there his father-in-law, Suppabuddha, in a drunken fit, refuses to let the Buddha pass through the streets. Seven days later he is swallowed up by the earth at the foot of his palace (DhA.iii.44).<br>The chief event of the sixteenth year, which the Buddha spent at āḷavī, is the conversion of the yakkha āḷavaka. In the seventeenth year the Buddha is back at Sāvatthi, but he visits āḷavī again out of compassion for a poor farmer who becomes a sotāpanna after hearing him preach (DhA.iii.262ff). He spends the rainy season at Rājagaha. In the next year he again comes to āḷavī from Jetavana for the sake of a poor weaver’s daughter. She had heard him preach, three years earlier, on the desirability of meditating upon death. She alone gave heed to his admonition and, when the Buddha knows of her imminent death, he journeys thirty leagues to preach to her and establish her in the sotāpattiphala (DhA.iii.170ff).<br>The Retreat of this year and also that of the nineteenth are spent at Cālikapabbata. In the twentieth year takes place the miraculous conversion of the robber Angulimāla. He becomes an arahant and dies shortly after. It is in the same year that Ananda is appointed permanent attendant on the Buddha, a position which he holds to the end of the Buddha’s life, twenty-five years later (For details see Ananda). The twentieth Retreat is spent at Rājagaha.<br>With our present knowledge it is impossible to evolve any kind of chronology for the remaining twenty-five years of the Buddha’s life. The Commentaries state that they were spent at Sāvatthi in the monasteries of Jetavana and Pubbārāma. (E.g., BuA.3; SNA. p.336f, says that when the Buddha was at Sāvatthi, he spent the day at the Migāramātupāsāda in the Pubbārāma, and the night at Jetavana or vice versa).<br>This, probably, only implies that the Retreats were kept there and that they were made the head quarters of the Buddha. From there, during the dry season, he went every year on tour in various districts. Among the places visited by him during these tours are the following:<br>Aggālavacetiya, Anotatta, Andhakavinda, Ambapālivana, Ambalatthikā, Ambasandā, Assapura, āpaṇa, Icchānaṅgala, Ukkatthā (Subhagavana), Ukkācelā, Ugganagara, Ujuññā (Kannakaṭṭhaka deer-park), Uttara in Koliya, Uttarakā, Uttarakuru, Uruvelakappa, Ulumpa, Ekanālā, Opasāda, Kakkarapatta, Kajaṅgalā (Mukheluvana), Kammāssadhamma, Kalandakanivāpa (near Benares), Kimbilā, Kītāgiri, Kundadhānavana (near Kundakoli), Kesaputta, Kotigāma, Kosambī (Ghositārāma and Badarikārāma), Khānumata, Khomadussa, Gosingasālavana, Candalakappa, Campā (Gaggarā), Cātuma, Cetiyagiri in Vesāli, Jīvakambavana (in Rājagaha), Tapodārāma, Tindukkhānu (paribbājakārāma), Todeyya, Thullakotthita, Dakkhināgiri, Dandakappa, Devadaha, Desaka in the Sumbha country, Nagāraka, Nagaravinda, Nādikā (Giñjakāvasatha), Nālandā (Pāvārika mango-grove), Nālakapāna (Palāsavana), Pankadhā, Pañcasalā, Pātikārāma, Beluva, the Brahma world, Bhaddavatī, Bhaddiya (Jātiyāvana), Bhaganagara (Anandacetiya), Manināḷakacetiya, Mana-sākata, Mātulā, Mithilā (Makhādeva mango-grove), Medatalumpa, Moranivāpa, Rammaka’s hermitage, Latthivana, Videha, Vedhañña-ambavana, Venāgapura, Verañjā, Veludvāra, Vesāli (also various shrines there, Udenacetiya, Gotamacetiya, Cāpalacetiya, Bahuputta-kacetiya, Sattambacetiya, Sārandadacetiya), Sakkara, Sajjanela, Salalāgāraka in Sāvatthi, Sāketa (Añjanavana), Sāmagāma, Sālavatikā, Sālā, Simsapāvana, Silāvatī, Sītavana, Sūkarakhatalena, Setavyā, Hatthigāma, Halidavassana and the region of the Himālaya.<br>There is a more or less continuous account of the last year of the Buddha’s life. This is contained in three suttas: the Mahā Parinibbāna, the Mahā Sudassana and the Janavasabha. These are not separate discourses but are intimately connected with each other. The only event prior to the incidents recounted in these suttas, which can be fixed with any certainty, is the death of the Buddha’s pious patron and supporter, Bimbisāra, which took place eight years before the Buddha’s Parinibbāna (Mhv.ii.32). It was at this time that Devadatta tried to obtain for himself a post of supremacy in the Order, and, failing in this effort, became the open enemy of the Buddha. Devadatta’s desire to deprive the Buddha of the leadership of the Sangha seems to have been conceived by him, according to the Vinaya account (Vin.ii.184), almost immediately after he joined the Order, and the Buddha was warned of this by the devaputta Kakudha. This account lends point to the statement contained especially in the Northern books, that even in their lay life Devadatta had always been Gotama’s rival.<br>Enlisting the support of Ajātasattu, he tried in many ways to kill the Buddha. Royal archers were bribed to shoot the Buddha, but they were won over by his personality and confessed their intentions. Then Devadatta hurled a great rock down Gijjhakūta on to the Buddha as he was walking in the shade of the hill; the hurtling rock was stopped by two peaks, but splinters struck the Buddha’s foot and caused blood to flow; he suffered great pain and had to be taken to the Maddakucchi garden, where his injuries were dressed by the physician Jīvaka (S.i.27). The monks wished to provide a guard, but the Buddha reminded them that no man had the power to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.<br>Devadatta next bribed the royal elephant keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nālāgiri, intoxicated with toddy, on the road along which the Buddha would go, begging for alms. The Buddha was warned of this but disregarded the warning, and when the elephant appeared, Ananda, against the strict orders of the Buddha, threw himself in its path, and only by an exercise of iddhi-power, including the folding up of the earth, could the Buddha come ahead of him. As the elephant approached, the Buddha addressed it, pervading it with his boundless love, until it became quite gentle. (This incident, with great wealth of detail, is related in several places - e.g., in J.v.333ff).<br>These attempts to encompass the Buddha’s death having failed, Devadatta, with three others, decides to create a schism in the Order and asks the Buddha that five rules should be laid down, whereby the monks would be compelled to lead a far more austere life than hitherto. When this request is refused, Devadatta persuades five hundred recently ordained monks to leave Vesāli with him and take up their residence at Gayāsīsa, where he would set up an organisation similar to that of the Buddha. But, at the Buddha’s request, Sāriputta and Moggallāna visit the renegade monks; Sāriputta preaches to them and they are persuaded to return. When Devadatta discovers this, he vomits hot blood and lies ill for nine months. When his end approaches, he wishes to see the Buddha, but he dies on the way to Jetavana - whither he is being conveyed in a litter - and is born in Avīci.<br>From Gijjhakūta, near Rājagaha, the Buddha starts on his last journey. Just before his departure he is visited by Vassākāra, and the talk is of the Vajjians; the Buddha preaches to Vassākāra and the monks on the conditions that lead to prosperity. The Buddha proceeds with a large concourse of monks to Ambalatthikā and thence to Nālandā, where Sāriputta utters his lion-roar (sīhanāda) regarding his faith in the Buddha. The Buddha then goes to Pātaligāma, where he talks to the villagers on the evil consequences of immorality and the advantages of morality. He utters a prophecy regarding the future greatness of Pātaliputta and then, leaving by the Gotamadvāra, he crosses the river Ganges at Gotamatittha. He proceeds to Kotigāma and thence to Ñātika, where he gives to Ananda the formula of the Dhammādāsa, whereby the rebirth of disciples could be ascertained. From Ñātika he goes to Vesāli, staying in the park of the courtesan Ambapāli. The following day he accepts a meal from Ambapāli, refusing a similar offer from the Licchavis; Ambapāli makes a gift of her park to the Buddha and his monks. The Buddha journeys on to Beluva, where he spends the rainy season, his monks remaining in Vesāli. At Beluva he falls dangerously ill but, with great determination, fights against his sickness. He tells Ananda that his mission is finished, that when he is dead the Order must maintain itself, taking the Dhamma alone as its refuge, and he concludes by propounding the four subjects of mindfulness (D.ii.100). The next day he begs in Vesāli and, with Ananda, visits the Cāpāla-cetiya. There he gives to Ananda the opportunity of asking him to live until the end of the kappa, but Ananda fails to take the hint. Soon afterwards Māra visits the Buddha and obtains the assurance that the Buddha’s nibbāna will take place in three months. There is an earthquake, and, in answer to Ananda’s questions, the Buddha explains to him the eight causes of earthquakes. This is followed by lists of the eight assemblies, the eight stages of mastery and the eight stages of release. The Buddha then repeats to Ananda his conversation with Māra, and Ananda now makes his request to the Buddha to prolong his life, but is told that it is now too late; several opportunities he has had, of which he has failed to avail himself. The monks are assembled in Vesāli, in the Service Hall, and the Buddha exhorts them to practise the doctrines he has taught, in order that the religious life may last long. He then announces his impending death.<br>According to the Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.549), after the rainy season spent at Beluva, the Buddha goes back to Jetavana, where he is visited by Sāriputta, who is preparing for his own Parinibbāna at Nālakagāma. From Jetavana the Buddha went to Rājagaha, where Mahā-Moggallāna died. Thence he proceeded to Ukkācelā, where he spoke in praise of the two chief disciples. From Ukkācelā he proceeded to Vesāli and thence to Bhandagāma. Rāhula, too, predeceased the Buddha (DA.ii.549).<br>The next day, returning from Vesāli, he looks round at the city for the last time and goes on to Bhandagāma; there he preaches on the four things the comprehension of which destroys rebirth-noble conduct, earnestness in meditation, wisdom and freedom.<br>He then passes through the villages of Hatthigāma, Ambagāma and Jambugama, and stays at Bhoganagara at the Ananda-cetiya. There he addresses the monks on the Four Great Authorities (Mahāpadesā), by reference to which the true doctrine may be determined (Cf. A.ii.167ff). From Bhoganagara the Buddha goes to Pāvā and stays in the mango-grove of Cunda, the smith. Cunda serves him with a meal which includes sūkaramaddava. (There is much dispute concerning this word. See Thomas, op. cit., 149, n.3). The Buddha alone partakes of the sūkaramaddava, the remains being buried. This is the Buddha’s last meal; sharp sickness arises in him, with flow of blood and violent, deadly pains, but the Buddha controls them and sets out for Kusinārā. On the way he has to sit down at the foot of a tree. Ananda fetches him water to drink from the stream Kakutthā, over which five hundred carts had just passed; but, through the power of the Buddha, the water is quite clear. Here the Buddha is visited by Pukkusa, the Mallan, who is converted and presents the Buddha with a pair of gold-coloured robes. The Buddha puts them on and Ananda notices the marvellous brightness and clearness of the Buddha’s body. The Buddha tells him that the body of a Buddha takes on this hue on the night before his Enlightenment and on the night of his passing away, and that he will die that night at Kusinārā. He goes to the Kākutthā, bathes and drinks there and rests in a mango-grove. There he instructs Ananda that steps must be taken to dispel any remorse that Cunda may feel regarding the meal he gave to the Buddha.<br>From Kakutthā the Buddha crosses the Hiraññavatī to the Upavattana sāla-grove in Kusinārā. There Ananda prepares for him a bed with the head to the north. All the trees break forth into blossom and flowers cover the body of the Buddha. Divine mandārava-flowers and sandalwood powder fall from the sky, and divine music and singing sound through the air. But the Buddha says that the greater honour to him would be to follow his teachings.<br>The gods of the ten thousand world systems assemble to pay their last homage to the Buddha, and Upavāna, who stands fanning him, is asked to move away as he obstructs their view.<br>Ananda asks for instruction on several points, including how the funeral rites should be performed; he then goes out and abandons himself to a fit of weeping; the Buddha sends for him, consoles him and speaks his praises. Ananda tries to persuade the Buddha not to die in a mud-and-wattle village, such as is Kusinārā, but the Buddha tells him how it was once the mighty Kusāvatī, capital of Mahāsudassana.<br>The Mallas of Kusināra are informed that the Buddha will pass away in the third watch of the night, and they come with their families to pay their respects. The ascetic Subhadda comes to see the Buddha and is refused admission by Ananda, but the Buddha, overhearing, calls him in and converts him. Several minor rules of discipline are delivered, including the order for the excommunication of Channa. The Buddha finally asks the assembled monks to speak out any doubts they may have. All are silent and Ananda expresses his astonishment, but the Buddha tells him it is natural that the monks should have no doubts. Then, addressing the monks for the last time, he admonishes them in these words: ”Decay is inherent in all component things; work out your salvation with diligence.” These were the Buddha’s last words. Passing backwards and forwards through various stages of trance, he attains Parinibbāna. There is a great earthquake and terrifying thunder, and the Brahmā Sahampati, Sakka king of the gods, Anuruddha and Ananda utter stanzas, each proclaiming the feeling uppermost in his mind. It is the full-moon day of the month of Visākha and the Buddha is in his eightieth year.<br>The next day Ananda informs the Mallas of Kusinārā of the Buddha’s death, and for seven days they hold a great celebration. On the seventh day, following Ananda’s instructions, they prepare the body for cremation, taking it in procession by the eastern gate to the Makutabandhana shrine, thus altering their proposed route, in order to satisfy the wishes of the gods, as communicated to them by Anuruddha. The whole town is covered knee-deep with mandārava-flowers, which fall from the sky. When, however, four of the chief Mallas try to light the pyre, their attempt is unsuccessful and they must wait until Mahā Kassapa, coming with a company of five hundred monks, has saluted it. The Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.603) add that Mahā Kassapa greatly desired that the Buddha’s feet should rest on his head when he worshipped the pyre. The wish was granted: the feet appeared through the pyre, and when Kassapa had worshipped them, the pyre closed together. The pyre burns completely away, leaving no cinders nor soot. Streams of water fall from the sky to extinguish it and the Mallas pour on it scented water. They then place a fence of spears around it and continue their celebrations for seven days. At the end of that period there appear several claimants for the Buddha’s relics: Ajātasattu, the Licchavis of Vesāli, the Sākiyans of Kapilavatthu, the Bulis of Allakappa, the Koliyas of Rāmagāma, a brahmin of Vethadīpa and the Mallas of Pāvā. But the Mallas of Kusinārā refusing to share the relics with the others, there is danger of war. Then the brahmin Dona counsels concord and divides the relics into eight equal parts for the eight claimants. Dona takes for himself the measuring vessel and the Moriyas of Pipphalivana, who arrive late, carry off the ashes. Thūpas were built over these remains and feasts held in honour of the Buddha.<br>The concluding passage of the Mahā-Parinibbāna Sutta (D.ii.167) states that the Buddha’s relics were eight measures, seven of which were honoured in Jambudīpa and the remaining one in the Nāga realm in Rāmagāma. One tooth was in heaven, one in Gandhāra, a third in Kālinga (later taken to Ceylon), and a fourth in the Nāga world. Ajātasattu’s share was deposited in a thūpa and forgotten. It was later discovered by Asoka (with the help of Sakka) and distributed among his eighty-four thousand monasteries. Asoka also recorded the finding of all the other relics except those deposited in Rāmagāma. These were later deposited in the Mahācetiya at Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxxi.17ff). Other relics are also mentioned, such as the Buddha’s collar-bone, his alms bowl, etc. (Mhv.xvii.9ff; Mhv.i.37, etc.).<br>It is said (E.g., DA.iii.899) that just before the Buddha’s Sāsana disappears completely from the world, all the relics will gather together at the Mahācetiya, and travelling from there to Nāgadīpa and the Ratanacetiya, assemble at the Mahābodhi, together with the relics from other parts. There they will reform the Buddha’s golden hued body, emitting the six-coloured aura. The body will then catch fire and completely disappear, amid the lamentations of the ten thousand world-systems.<br>The Ceylon Chronicles (Mhv.i.12ff; Dpv.i.45ff; ii.1ff etc.) record that the Buddha visited the Island on three separate occasions.<br>(The Burmese claim that the Buddha visited their land and went to the Lohitacandana Vihāra, presented by the brothers Mahāpunna and Cūlapunna of Vānijagāma (Ind. Antiq.xxii., and Sās.36f.).<br>The first was while he was dwelling at Uruvelā, awaiting the moment for the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas, in the ninth month after the Enlightenment, on the full-moon day of Phussa (Dec.-Jan.). He came to the Mahānāga garden, and stood in the air over an assembly of yakkhas then being held. He struck terror into their hearts and, at his suggestion, they left Ceylon and went in a body to Giridīpa, hard by. The Buddha gave a handful of his hair to the deva Mahāsumana of the Sumanakūta mountain, who built a thūpa which was later enlarged into the Mahiyaṅgana Thūpa. The Buddha again visited Ceylon in the fifth year, on the new-moon day of Citta (March-April), to check an imminent battle between two Nāga chiefs in Nāgadīpa; the combatants were Mahodara and Cūlodara, uncle and nephew, and the object of the quarrel was a gem-set throne. The Buddha appeared before them, accompanied by the deva Samiddhi-Sumana, carrying a Rājayatana tree from Jetavana, settled their quarrel and received, as a gift, the throne, the cause of the trouble. He left behind him both the throne and the Rājayatana tree for the worship of the Nāgās and accepted an invitation from the Nāga king, Maniakkhika of Kalyāni, to pay another visit to Ceylon. Three years later Maniakkhika repeated the invitation and the Buddha came to Kalyāni with five hundred monks, on the second day of Vesākha. Having preached to the Nāgas, he went to Sumanakūta, on the summit of which mountain he left the imprint of his foot (Legend has it that other footprints were left by the Buddha, on the bank of the river Nammadā, on the Saccabaddha mountain and in Yonakapura). He then stayed at Dīghavāpī and from there visited Mahāmeghavana, where he consecrated various spots by virtue of his presence, and proceeded to the site of the later Silācetiya. From there he returned to Jetavana.<br>Very little information as to the personality of the Buddha is available. We are told that he was golden-hued (E.g., Sp.iii.689), that his voice had the eight qualities of the Brahmassāra (E.g., D.ii.211; M.ii.166f. It is said that while an ordinary person spoke one word, Ananda could speak eight; but the Buddha could speak sixteen to the eight of Ananda, MA.i.283) - fluency, intelligibility, sweetness, audibility, continuity, distinctness, depth and resonance - that he had a fascinating personality - he was described by his opponents as seductive (E.g., M.i.269, 275) - that he was handsome, perfect alike in complexion and stature and noble of presence (E.g., M.ii.167). He had a unique reputation as a teacher and trainer of the human heart. He was endowed with the thirty-two marks of the Mahāpurisa. (For details of these, see Buddha). There is a legend that Mahā Kassapa, though slightly shorter, resembled the Buddha in appearance.<br>Attempts made, however, to measure the Buddha always failed; two such attempts are generally mentioned - one by a brahmin of Rājagaha and the other by Rāhu, chief of the Asuras (DA.i.284f). The Buddha had the physical strength of many millions of elephants (e.g., VibhA.397), but his strength quickly ebbed away after his last meal and he had to stop at twenty-five places while travelling three gāvutas from Pāvā to Kusināra (DA.ii.573).<br>Mention is often made of the Buddha’s love of quiet and peace, and even the heretics respected his wishes in this matter, silencing their discussions at his approach (E.g., D.i.178f; iii.39; even his disciples had a similar reputation, e.g., D.iii.37). Examples are given of the Buddha refusing to allow noisy monks to live near him. (E.g., M.i.456; see also M.ii.122, where a monk was jogged by his neighbour because he coughed when the Buddha was speaking). He loved solitude and often spent long periods away from the haunts of men, allowing only one monk to bring him his meals. E.g., S.v.12, 320; but this very love of solitude was sometimes brought against him. By intercourse with whom does he attain to lucidity in wisdom? they asked. His insight, they said, was ruined by his habit of seclusion (D.iii.38).<br>According to one account (A.i.181), it was his practice to spend part of the day in seclusion, but he was always ready to see anyone who urgently desired his spiritual counsel (E.g., A.iv.438).<br>In the Mahā Govinda Sutta (D.ii.222f ) Sakka is represented as having uttered ”eight true praises” of the Buddha. Perhaps the most predominant characteristics of the Buddha were his boundless love and his eagerness to help all who sought him. His fondness for children is seen in such stories as those of the two Sopākas, of Kumāra-Kassapa, of Cūla Panthaka and Dabba-Mallaputta and also of the novices Pandita and Sukha. His kindness to animals appears, for instance, in the introductory story of the Maccha Jātaka and his interference on behalf of Udena’s aged elephant, Bhaddavatikā (q.v.). The Buddha was extremely devoted to his disciples and encouraged them in every way in their difficult life. The Theragāthā and the Therīgāthā are full of stories indicating that he watched, with great care, the spiritual growth and development of his disciples, understood their problems and was ready with timely interference to help them to win their aims. Such incidents as those mentioned in the Bhaddāli Sutta (M.i.445), the introduction to the Tittha Jātaka and the Kañcakkhandha Jātaka, seem to indicate that he took a personal and abiding interest in all who came under him. It was his unvarying custom to greet with a smile all those who visited him, inquiring after their welfare and thus putting them at their ease (Vin.i.313). When anyone sought permission to question him, he made no conditions as to the topic of discussion. This is called sabbaññupavāraṇa. E.g., M.i.230. When the Buddha himself asked a question of any of his interrogators, they could not remain silent, but were bound to answer; a yakkha called Vajirapāni was always present to frighten those who did not wish to do so (e.g., M.i.231).<br>The Buddha was not over-anxious to get converts, and when his visitors declared themselves his followers he would urge them to take time to consider the matter - e.g., in the case of Acela Kassapa and Upāligahapati.<br>When he was staying in a monastery, he paid daily visits to the sick ward to talk to the inmates and to comfort them (See, e.g., Kutāgārasālā). The charming story of Pūtigata-Tissa shows that he sometimes attended on the sick himself, thus setting an example to his followers. In return for his devotion, his disciples adored him, but even among those who immediately surrounded him there were a few who refused to obey him implicitly - e.g., Lāludāyī, the companions of Assaji and Punabbasuka, the Chabbaggiyas, the Sattarasavaggiyas and others, not to mention Devadatta and his associates.<br>The Buddha seems to have shown a special regard for Sāriputta, Ananda and Mahā Kassapa among the monks, and for Anāthapindika, Mallikā, Visakhā, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi among the laity. He seems to have been secretly amused by the very human qualities of Pasenadi and by his failure to appreciate the real superiority of Mallikā, his wife.<br>The Buddha always declared that he was among the happy ones of this earth, that he was far happier, for instance, than Bimbisāra (E.g., M.i.94), and he remained unmoved by opposition or abuse. E.g., in the case of the organised conspiracy of Māgandiyā (DhA.iv.1f.).<br>The Milindapañha (p.134) mentions several illnesses of the Buddha: the injury to his foot has already been referred to; once when the humours of his body were disturbed Jīvaka administered a purge (Vin.i.279); on another occasion he suffered from some stomach trouble which was cured by hot water, or, according to some, by hot gruel (Vin.i.210f.; Thag.185). The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.232; ThagA.i.311f) mentions another disorder of the humours cured by hot water obtained from the brahmin Devahita, through Upavāna. The Commentaries mention that he suffered, in his old age, from constant backache, owing to the severe austerities practised by him during the six years preceding his Enlightenment, and the unsuitable meals taken during that period were responsible for a dyspepsia which persisted throughout the rest of his life (SA.i.200), culminating in his last serious illness of dysentery. MA.i.465; DA.iii.974; see also D.iii.209, when he was preaching to the Mallas of Pāvā.<br>The Apadāna (Ap.i.299f) contains a set of verses called Pubbakammapiloti; these verses mention certain acts done by the Buddha in the past, which resulted in his having to suffer in various ways in his last birth. He was once a drunkard named Munāli and he abused the Pacceka Buddha Surabhi. On another occasion he was a learned brahmin, teacher of five hundred pupils. One day, seeing the Pacceka Buddha Isigana, he spoke ill of him to his pupils, calling him ”sensualist.” The result of this act was the calumny against him by Sundarikā in this life.<br>In another life he reviled a disciple of a Buddha, named Nanda; for this he suffered in hell for twelve thousand years and, in his last life, was disgraced by Ciñcā. Once, greedy for wealth, he killed his step-brothers, hurling them down a precipice; as a result, Devadatta attempted to kill him by hurling down a rock. Once, as a boy, while playing on the highway, he saw a Pacceka Buddha and threw a stone at him, and as a result, was shot at by Devadatta’s hired archers. In another life he was a mahout, and seeing a Pacceka Buddha on the road, drove his elephant against him; hence the attack by Nālāgiri. Once, as a king, he sentenced seventy persons to death, the reward for which he reaped when a splinter pierced his foot. Because once, as a fisherman’s son, he took delight in watching fish being caught, he suffered from a grievous headache when Vidūdabha slaughtered the Sākiyans. In the time of Phussa Buddha he asked the monks to eat barley instead of rice and, as a result, had to eat barley for three months at Verañja. (According to the Dhammapada Commentary \[iii.257\], the Buddha actually had to starve one day at Pañcasālā, because none of the inhabitants were willing to give him alms.) Because he once killed a wrestler, he suffered from cramp in the back. Once, when a physician, he caused discomfort to a merchant by purging him, hence his last illness of dysentery. As Jotipāla, he spoke disparagingly of the Enlightenment of Kassapa Buddha, and in consequence had to spend six years following various paths before becoming the Buddha. He was one of the most short-lived Buddhas, but because of those six years his Sāsana will last longer (Sp.i.190f).<br>The Buddha was generally addressed by his own disciples as Bhagavā. He spoke of himself as Tathāgata, while non-Buddhists referred to him as Gotama or Mahāsamana. Other names used are Mahāmuni, Sākyamuni, Jina, Sakka (e.g., Sn.vs.345) and Brahma (Sn.vs.91; SnA.ii.418), also Yakkha (q.v.).<br>The Anguttara Nikāya (A.i.23ff) gives a list of the Buddha’s most eminent disciples, both among members of the Order and among the laity. Each one in the list is mentioned as having possessed pre-eminence in some particular respect.<br>Among those who visited the Buddha for discussion or had interviews with him or received instruction and guidance direct from him, the following may be included in addition to those already mentioned (this list does not pretend to be complete; some of the names have already been mentioned in this monograph in various connections):<br>Ankura, Aggidatta, Acela-Kassapa, Ajātasattu, Ajita the Paribbājaka, Ajita the Licchavi general, Attadattha, Anitthigandhakumāra, Anurāddha, Anuruddha, Annabhāra, Abhaya-rājakumāra, Abhayā, Abhiñjaka, Abhibhūta, Abhirūpa-Nandā, Ambattha, the monk Arittha, Ariya the fisherman, Asama, Asibandhaputta, Assaji, Assalāyana, ākoṭaka, āmagandha, the yakkhas āḷavaka and Indaka, Ugga of Vesāli, Ugga the minister, Uggata-Sarīra, Uggaha, Ujjaya, Unnābha, Uttara-devaputta, Uttara the Nāga king, Uttara, pupil of Pārasariya, Uttiya, Udaya and Udāyi the brahmins, Uttara, pupil of Brahmāyu, Uttarā, daughter of Punna, Uttarā the aged nun, Upavāna, Upasāḷha, Upasena, Upāligahapati, Ubbirī, Eraka, Esakārī, Kakudha, Kandāraka, Kapila the fisherman, Kappa, Kappatakura, Kāḷārakkhattiya, Kassapa the deva, Kāna, Kānamātā, Kātiyāna, Kāpathika, Kāmada, Kāranapāli, the Kālāmas, Kāligodhā, Kimbila, Kisāgotami, Kukkutamitta the hunter, Kundadhāna, Kundaliya, Kulla, Kūtadanta, Keniya the Jatila, Kevaddha, Kesi the horse trainer, Kokanadā, the two daughters of Pajjuna, Kokālika, Khadiravaniya-Revata, Khānu-Kondañña, Khema the deva, Khemā, Ganaka-Moggallāna, Gavampati, Guttā, Gotama Thera, Cankī, Candana, Candābha, Candimā (Candimasa), Citta-Hatthasārīputta, Cunda, Cunda-Samanuddesa, Cundī, Culla-Dhanuggaha, Culla-Subhaddhā, Chattapānī, Janapada-Kalyāni-Nandā, Janavasabha, Jantu, Jambuka, Jambukhādaka, Jānussoni, Jāliya, Jīvaka-Komārabhacca, Jenta, Jotikagahapati, Tāyana, Tālaputa, Tikanna, Timbaruka, Tissa, cousin of the Buddha, Tissa, friend of Metteyya, Tissa of Roruva, Tudu-brahmā, Thulla-Tissa, Dandapanī, Dāmalī, Dāsaka, Dīgha the deva, Dīghajānu, Dīghata-passī, Dīghanakha, Dīghalatthi, Dīghāvu, Dummukha, Dona, Dhammadinna, Dhammārāma, the Dhammika-upāsaka, Dhammika the brahmin, Nanda Thera, Nanda the herdsman, Nandana, Nandiya-paribbājaka, Nandiya the Sākiyan, Nandivisāla, Nāgita, Nālakatāpasa, Nālijangha, Nigamavāsi-Tissa, Nigrodha, Ninka, Nīta, Nhātakamunī, Paccanīkasāta, Pañcasikha, Pañcālacanda, Patācārā, Pasenadi, king of Kosala, Pahārāda the asura, Pātaliya, Pārāpariya, Pingala-Kaccha, Pingiyānī, Pilinda-Vaccha, Pilotika, Punna, Punna-Koliyaputta, Punna-Mantānīputta, Punnā, Punniya, Pessa the elephant trainer, Pokkharasāti, Potthapāda, Pothila, Potaliya, Phagguṇa, Baka-brahmā, Bahuputtikā, Bāvarī and his sixteen disciples, Bāhiya-Dārucīriya, Bāhuna, Bilālapādaka, Belatthakāni, Bojjhā, Brahmāyu, Bhagu, Bhaggava, Bhadda, Bhaddā-Kundakakesī, Bhaddāli, Bhaddiya the Licchavi, several Bhāra-dvājas (Akkosaka*, Aggika*, Asurinda*, Ahimsaka*, Kāsi*, Jatā*, Navakammika*, Bilangika*, Suddhika*, Sundarika*), Bhāradvāja, husband of Dhanañjāni, Bhāradvāja, friend of Vāsettha, Bhuñjati, Bhumiya, Bhesika the barber, Macchari-Kosiya, Manibhadda, Mandissa, Mahā-kappina, Mahā-Kassapa, Mahā-kotthita, Mahā-Cunda, Mahā-dhana, Mahā-nāma, Mahā-Moggallāna, Mahāli (Otthaddha), the two Māgandiyas - one the brahmin and one the paribbājaka, Māgha, Mānava-Gāmiya, Mānatthaddha, Mātuposaka, Mālunkyaputta, Miga-jāla, Migasira, Mendaka of Bhaddiya, Moliya-Phagguṇa, Moliya-Sīvaka, Yasoja, Ratthapāla, Rādha, Rāhula, Rāsiya, Rūpānandā, Roja the Malla, Rohinī, Rohitassa, Lakuntaka-Bhaddiya, the goddess Lājā, Lomasakangiya, Lohicca, Vakkali, Vangisa, Vajjiyamāhita, Vaddha the Licchavi, Vaddhamāna, Vappa, Varadhara, Vassakāra, Vārana, Vāsettha-upāsaka, Vāsettha, friend of Bhāradvāja, Visākha Pañcalaputta, Visākhā, Vīrā, Vekhanasa, Vendu, Vatambari, Sakuludāyi, Sakka, Sankicca, the two Sangāravas, Sangharakkhita (Bhāgineyya°), Saccaka, Sajjha, Satullapa-devas, Sanankumāra, Santati, Sandha, Sandhāna, Samiddhi, Sarabha, Sarabhaṅga, Sātāgira, Sātāli, Sāti, Sānu, Sikhā-Moggallāna, Sigāla, Sirimā, Siva, Sīvali, Sīha the general, Sukhā, Suciloma, Sujātā, daughter-in-law of Anāthapindika, Sudatta, Sunakkhatta, Sunīta, Sundara-Samudda, Sundarī-Nandā, the leper Suppabuddha, Suppa-vāsā, Subha Todeyyaputta, the two nuns named Subhā, Subhūti, the novice Sumana, Sumanā, sister of Pasenadi, Subrahmā, Surādha, Suriya, Susima, Seniya, Seri, Sela, Sona-Kutikanna, Sona-Kolivisa, Sonadanda, Sonā, the two Sopākas, Haṭṭhaka āḷavaka, Haṭṭhaka-devaputta and Hemavata.<br>See also Buddha and Bodhisatta.<br>Other Gotamas'],

His instructions are with reason (A.i.276f).<br>It is said that at this pronouncement the thousand fold universe trembled (Also DA.i.130; J.ii.259).<br>The Majjhima Commentary (i.49) states that the Sutta was preached to the monks mentioned in the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, and that, at the end, they became arahants.'],
'gotamakacetiya':['A shrine near and to the south of Vesāli (D.iii.9). It was considered one of the beautiful spots of that town (E.g., D.ii.102, 118) and the Buddha stayed there several times, particularly during the first years of his ministry (Thus AA.i.457). During one such stay, he laid down the rule which allowed monks the use of three robes; he himself felt cold during the night and had to wear extra clothing (Vin.i.288; iii.195).<br>The shrine was pre-Buddhistic and dedicated to a Yakkha named Gotamaka. A vihāra was later built on the spot for the Buddha and his monks (UdA.322; DhA.iii.246; AA.i.457; SNA.i.344).<br>There the Gotamaka Sutta was preached. (And, according to some, also the Hemavata Sutta \[SNA.i.199\]).<br>The Divyāvadāna (p.201), in a list of noted places of Vesāli, speaks of a Gautama-nyagrodha. The reference is evidently to this cetiya. It has been suggested that the cetiya may have been called after the Kāla (Kanha) Gotama Nāgas, but the suggestion appears far-fetched. See J. P.T.S.1891, p.67; Windisch: Mara and Buddha, p.68; cp. J.ii.145.'],

'gotapabbata':['A vihāra in South Ceylon built by Mahallaka-Nāga (Mhv.xxxv.124). It may be that it is identical with Kotapabbata-vihāra and that Mahallaka merely restored it. v.l. Kotapabbata.'],

Gothakābhaya became Sanghabodhi’s treasurer but, seeing the king’s weakness, he led a rebellion against him and captured the throne (vv.91, 98-117; for details see Sanghabodhi). In addition to other religious works, he built the Meghavannābhaya-Vihāra. He banished from Abhayagiri sixty monks who had accepted the Vetulla heresy, but a Cola monk, Sanghamitta, defeated in discussion the thera Gothābhaya, the king’s uncle, and became the king’s favourite, obtaining the position of tutor to the king’s two sons, Jetthatissa and Mahāsena.

Kākavannatissa, hearing of this, sent for him to the court (Mhv.xxiii.49ff; the Rasavāhini ii.28, says he subdued a yakkha named Jayasena). He took a prominent part in the attack on Vijitapura, using a coconut-palm as weapon (Mhv.xxv.27, 32, 44f).<br>It is said (MT.452) that in the time of Kassapa Buddha he gave daily milk rice to the monks.<br>See also Ras.ii.87f, which says that he was so called because he was short, but that according to the Uttara-vihāra monks he was given the name because, when he went hunting, he killed animals by dashing them on koṭṭhayimbara-trees. Once when he was holding a feast in his house, after defeating the Damilas, a Yakkha, named Jayasena of Aritthapabbata, happened to pass by, and, entering the house, fell in love with G.’s wife. G. challenged him to a fight and defeated him. He celebrated the victory for seven days and went to the palace drunk. Being refused admission, he swam across to Kāvīrapattana, and, having gone as far as the Himālaya in search of holy monks, was about to kill himself in despair when an arahant Thera appeared before him and ordained him.

He once went to Udakavana in Kosambī, and there the women of King Udena’s palace, who had come to the park with the king, left the king while he slept, and, finding the Elder, sat down and listened to his preaching. The king, awakening, went in search of them, and was angry when he discovered their where-abouts. He questioned Pindoḷa as to the solitude which he professed to seek in the park, but Pindoḷa refusing to answer, the king threatened to set red ants at him. Thereupon Pindoḷa went through the air to the Buddha’s Gandhakuti and related the story. The Buddha was reclining on his bed and, in that position, preached this sutta to the Elder.<br>A man who clings to the body and to the pleasures of the senses, lives in constant fear. One should therefore cast off greed and cross the flood, unstained by the world (SN.vv.772-9; SNA.ii.514ff).<br>The sutta probably derives its name from the fact that, in the first verse, the body is spoken of as a guhā.<br>It is commented on in the Mahā Niddesa pp.23ff.'],

Some of the men ate the honey, while others remembered the warning of the Bodhisatta as soon as they had tasted it. Those who ate died, the others were given emetics and recovered.<br>The story was related to a monk who, fascinated by a woman’s charm, wished to become a layman.

To show his gratitude the Lion took the Jackal and his wife home with him, and the two animals and their wives lived together, the Lion and the Jackal going out together hunting. Later on, the Lioness grew jealous of the she-Jackal and tried to frighten her away in the absence of their husbands. When the Lion heard of this, he told his wife how the Jackal had befriended him in his hour of danger, and thenceforth they all lived happily together.<br>The Jackal is identified with Ananda.<br>The story was told in reference to a gift made by Ananda. Once, when he had been preaching to the women of Pasenadi’s palace, they gave him five hundred new garments which the king had just presented to them. The king hearing of this was at first annoyed, but on questioning Ananda he was satisfied that no gift presented to the Sangha could ever be wasted. Delighted with this discovery, the king himself gave five hundred robes to Ananda, all of which Ananda presented to a young monk who was very useful and helpful to him. The monk, in his turn, distributed them among his fellow celibates, who wondered why Ananda should have singled out one monk as the recipient of his gifts. When the matter was related to the Buddha, he assured the monks that the gift was offered to the monk by Ananda only in return for numerous services (J.ii.23ff).<br>The Jātaka is also called Sīha Jātaka, and probably also theSigāla Jātaka.

It was the centre of several campaigns at different periods. (E.g., of Mahinda, Cv.li.109, 117; Vijayabāhu I., Cv.lxviii.34; Jayabāhu I., Cv.lxi.12; Parakkamabāhu I., Cv.lxxiv.165f.; lxxv.15.

Guttila, fearing a contest in his old age, fled into the forest where Sakka appeared before him and promised to help him to victory. The contest was held, and when Guttila played according to Sakka’s instructions, the sound of his music filled the city and heavenly nymphs descended to earth to dance. Mūsila was defeated and stoned to death by the enraged crowd. Later, Sakka sent Mātali to fetch Guttila to Tāvatimsa in his chariot, and as a return for his music Guttila was allowed to discover to what good deeds the inhabitants of Tāvatimsa owed their birth there. On returning to earth after seven days, he told the people what he had seen and exhorted them to do good (J.ii.248ff; VvA.137ff).<br>It is said that once Guttila sent a thousand to a woman, wishing to win her favour, but she would not grant it.

His chaplain, hearing that the deity of a certain banyan tree had the power of giving sons, went to the tree and threatened to cut it down unless Esukārī had a son. The tree deity consulted Sakka, who persuaded four devas to be born as the sons, not of Esukārī, but of his chaplain. On the day when the chaplain came to cut down the tree, the deity told him of Sakka’s decision, and also warned him that the sons would not live the household life. In due course the sons were born and were named Hatthipāla, Gopāla, Assapāla and Ajapāla. Various devices were adopted to prevent them from turning to the ascetic life. But when Hatthipāla grew up he insisted on leaving home and becoming an ascetic, heedless of the entreaties both of his father and of Esukārī. His brothers, when their time came, acted in the same way. Later, their parents joined them. The king sent for all their wealth, but the queen, being wise, made him realize by means of a simile the folly of such an act. Together they left the world and joined Hatthipāla and his family. The citizens followed their example till the whole city was empty.<br>Hatthipāla preached to them and they all became ascetics. His company covered an area of thirty leagues, and with it he went to the Himālaya, where Vissakamma, acting under Sakka’s orders, built for them a hermitage extending over thirty six leagues, on the bank’s of the Ganges. Soon after, other kings who, with their followers, had gone, one after another, to take Benares, realizing their folly, joined Hatthipāla and became ascetics.<br>The story was related in reference to the Buddha’s Great Renunciation. Suddhodana was Esukārī, Mahāmāyā his queen, Kassapa the chaplain, Bhaddā Kapilānī his wife, Anuruddha Ajapāla, Moggallāna Gopāla, Sāriputta Assapāla and the Buddha himself Hatthipāla.<br>The large concourse that followed Hatthipāla is called Hatthipālasamāgama, and in it were several who later attained arahantship in Ceylon - Phussadeva of Katakandhārakara, Mahāsaṅgharakkhita of Uparimandalakamalaya, Maliyamahādeva, Mahādeva of Bhaggagiri, Mahāsīva of Vimantapabbhāra, and Mahānāga of Kālavallimandapa (J.iv.473-91; referred to at J.i.45).

'hārita jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was born in a wealthy brahmin family and was called Harittaca because of his golden colour.

He accepted the invitation, and lived there for twelve years. The king was then called away to quell a frontier rebellion, and instructed the queen to look after the ascetic. One day, as the Bodhisatta came in late for his meal, the queen rose hastily and her robe of fine cloth fell from her. Harittaca was filled with lust, and, taking her hand and drawing a curtain round them, he lay with her. This then became a daily occurrence and the scandal spread abroad. The ministers wrote to the king, who, however, refused to believe them. When he returned he questioned the queen, who confessed her wrongdoing, but even then the king refused to believe it till Harittaca (or Hārita as he is also called) acknowledged his guilt. The king was full of admiration for his truthfulness and forgave him, but Harittaca, after preaching to the king on the misery of sinful desire, once more developed his mystic powers, took leave of the king, and returned to the Himālaya.<br>The story was told in reference to a monk who had grown discontented because of a beautiful woman.

It is full of woodlands and groves, suitable for hermits (E.g., SA.i.265). In Himavā is a peak named Mahāpapāta where Pacceka Buddhas die (SNA.i.129). Nāgas go to Himavā to give birth to their young (SA.iii.120; cf. S.v.63).

'hsuan tsang':['A well known Chinese monk who visited India and traversed a large number of countries covering more than 50,000 Li. Though the dangers that he encountered were many he fulfilled his main objective undaunted by them. His contribution to the cause of Buddhism in general and to the Great Vehicle in particular is immense. For these and many other reasons he is held by the Chinese Buddhists in the highest esteem among the pilgrims of his calibre.<br>The following information on Hsūan-tsang’s travels and his accounts of India and other countries which he travelled in his long journey is based mainly on two sources, namely, ”Si-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World” an English translation of the Chinese version of Hsūan-tsang and ”The Life of Hiuen-tsiang” an English translation of his biography written in Chinese by Shaman Hwui-li, a disciple of his. Among secondary sources the most useful treatise is ’On Yuan Chwang’s Travels in India’, a critical study written by Thomas Watters in 1961. This work is based on Hsūan-tsang’s Hsi-Yu-Shi (or Si-Yu-Ki) also entitled Buddhist Records of the Western World.<br>Hsūan-tsang was born in 603 A.C. in Chin-lu in the reign of Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty and lived about sixty-five years. Opinions, however, differ regarding the exact years of his birth and death. His secular name was Ch’en-Chin and he was the youngest of four brothers. His father was Ch’en-hui who devoted himself to the study of Confucious’ teachings. Even as a child Hsūan-tsang was unusually of grave temperament and intelligence. He did not enjoy the company of boys of his age nor did he appreciate their life style. His second brother, Chang-tse who had entered the Order previously took Hsūan-tsang to his own convent and made arrangements to impart instruction to him there.<br>Hsūan-tsang (= Ht.) was so studious that at times he studied without sleep and even food. At one hearing he is said to have comprehended a book thoroughly and after a second reading needed no further instruction. At the age of eleven he was versed in the Saddharmapundarika Sutra and the Vimalakirtinirdesa. At the age of thirteen he was admitted into the Order and was engaged in further studies.<br>The political situation in the country being unsatisfactory the two brothers went to Chang’an and from there again to Ch’eng-tu, the capital of Shu. There Hsūan-tsang followed lectures on the scriptures delivered by eminent scholars and in a few years he mastered the scriptures of various schools and earned a name as a scholar. It was about this time or a few years later that he came to be known by the appellation ”The Master of the Law”.<br>In the fifth year of Wu-te he received full ordination at Ch’eng-tu. He went to Chin-chow for further studies where he also conducted sermons as an advanced student. Scholar monks who gathered there as listeners treated him with great respect and admiration. Thereupon he went to Chaochow, Hsiang-chow and Ch’ang-an and studied the Samyuktābhidharma-hrdaya, the Mahāyāna-sangraha, the Abhidharma-kosa etc.<br>In a short time Ht. mastered all the theories of the different schools of Buddhism and was acclaimed as a great scholar. He found that Buddhist teachings he had learned, mainly those concerned with the theory of Dharmalaksana and the views held by the propounders of the Mahāyāna-Sangraha and those held by the followers of the Dasabhūmivyākarana were at variance. Moreover, he discerned many defects in the Chinese translations of the sacred books, and consequently he cherished the idea of going to India to learn at the feet of orthodox scholars. In this he was inspired to some extent by his forerunners Fa-hsien and Chi-yen who undertook similar tasks.<br>Overcoming many obstacles Ht., at the age of twenty-six years set forth from Chang-an and going through several provinces or countries came to Liang-chow where he received a companion to travel to the West. Despite the attempts of spies to detain him the governor of the province, Li-chiang, however, let him proceed on his journey. Some of the territories or countries which he traversed until he reached the borders of North India were Turfan (Kau-chang), Agni (O-ki-ni), Kuche (Kiuchi) an oasis in the Gobi desert, Nujkend (Nu-chin-kien), Chaf (Che-shi), Ferghanah (Fei-han in Turkestan), Sutrishna (Su-tu-Ii-sse-na), Samarkhand (Sa-mo-kien), Kesh (Ki-shwang-na), Kunduz (Hwo), Bhaktra or Bactria (Fo-ho-lo), Bamiyam (Fan-yen-na) and Kapisa (Kia-pi-she).<br>His journey was beset with dangers and hardships. As the only guide given him to accompany until the last of the watch towers in sandy desert also deserted him he went on all alone. The worst experience encountered was in the heart of the Mo-kia-yen desert which extended for 800 li. One hundred li after entering the desert he lost his way. By accident his water bag gave way without leaving a drop of water in it and he had to spend four nights and five days in the desert without water.<br>At a later stage when wending their way up the snow-clad Ling mountain, and the snowy mountain (Hindukush) lying to the south of Balkh, twelve or fourteen of his companions and an even greater number of oxen and horses met with death.<br>Obstacles caused by robbers on his way to India and also in India itself were more than embarrassing. Even governors or kings of certain countries embarrassed him as he was proceeding towards India. Although very hospitable and respectful to Ht. the king of Kam-chang, Khio-wen-tai planned to detain him in his court as his spiritual head. Ht. got out of this grip only by the threat of fasting unto death. Another attempt to detain him was made by the Great Khan of the Turks. As will appear below, Ht. underwent another such experience in Eastern India as well.<br>Of the countries which were traversed by Ht. on his way to North India, Bhaktra (Po-ho-lo), Bamiyan (Fanyen-na) and Kapisa (Kia-pi-she) were active centres of Buddhism. According to Ht, there were about three thousand monks of the Little Vehicle in Bhaktra. There was a scholar monk called Prajñākara who was versed in the three pitakas of the Little Vehicle. Ht. was pleased with his explanation of the doctrine of that school.<br>Ht. reached Bamiyan crossing Hindu-kush. In both Bamiyan and Kapisa, there were several thousand monks of the Little Vehicle. In Bamiyan there were three imposing figures of the Buddha. One of these was a standing figure of about 140 or 150 feet high. Another figure of the standing Buddha measures 100 feet in height. An enormous figure of the recumbent Buddha depicting his ’Nirvana’ measures 1000 feet in length.<br>At a conference held in a temple of the Great Vehicle in Kapisa Ht. being thorough with the teachings of both schools, proved his superiority over all who participated in it. From Kapisa onwards his itinerary covered territories in North India of which the following place names are graphed by Ht. into a separate unit. Lamghan (Lanpo), Nagarahara (Na-kie-to-ho), Gandhara (Kien-to-lo), Udyana (U-chang), Takshasila (Ta-ch’a-shi-lo), Urasa (Wu-la-sa), Kashmir (Kia-shi-mi-lo), Punach (Pun-nuh-t’so) and Rajapuri (Ho-lo-she-pu-lo). According to Ht, common people in the above territories differ to some extent from those of India in respect of manners, clothing and language.<br>Si-yu-ki, Buddhist Records of the Western World (Records) ed. Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1981, Bk. II, pp. 68, 917; The Life of Hiuen Tsiang (=The Life) ed. Samuel Beal, New Delhi, 1973, pp. 57-72. The countries from Lamgham to Rajapuri both inclusive were not regarded by the people of India proper as forming parts of their territory (Watters, Thomas, On Yuang Chwang’s Travels in India, pub. Munshi Ram Manohar Lal, Oriental Publishers and Booksellers, Delhi, 1961, p. 180, (Abbreviated as Watters).<br>Nagarahara (Jelalabad) occupies a prominent place as a country possessing Buddha’s relics. In Nagarahara or its neighbourhood Ht. rejoined his companions and went to Gandhara by the Khyber Pass. He gives the names of a number of sages and saints who composed sāstras there. Then he goes to describe the famous stupa of 400 feet in height ascribed to king Kanishka. It was situated in Purushapura (Po-lu-shu-po-lo), the capital of Gandhara.<br>Either side of the river Subhavastu (Su-po-fa-sa-tu) in the country of Udyana is said by Ht. to have been thickly populated by Buddhists in former days. At the time of his visit he saw the country depopulated. The few monks who were there at the time belonged to five different schools viz. the Dharmaguptas, the Mahisāsakas, the Kasyapiyas, the Sarvāstivadins and the Mahāsanghikas. Among the objects of worship are mentioned figures of Avalokitesvara and Maitreya bodhisattva.<br>In Takshasila, Urasa and Kashmir, too, he saw various Buddhist sites. The chief monk in Kashmir was of high moral character and of remarkable intelligence. This monk explained many parts of the doctrine to him. This learned teacher was so impressed by Ht. that the latter was compared to Asaṅga bodhisattva in respect of his wisdom. According to Ht.Kanishka, convened an assembly, known to history as the Fourth Council, in the four hundredth year from the ’Nirvana’ of the Tathāgata. Ht. stayed for two years studying sutras and sāstras.<br>Leaving Kashmir Ht. made his way to Punach and from there to Rajapuri. From Rajapuri he entered a different zone in North India arriving at Takka (Teheka) as its starting point. To the east of the town called Narasimha (Na-lo-sang-ho) he and the accompanying sāmaneras encountered a band of fifty robbers who robbed them of their belongings. However, a brahmin in the neighbourhood came to their help and they managed to escape with no loss of life. There he remained for one month, and for fourteen months in the kingdom of Chinapati (Chi-na-po-tai) studying various texts.<br>Before reaching the next important kingdom, Mathura (Mo-t’u-lo) he passed through the kingdoms of Jalandhara (She-lan-t’o-lo), Kuluta (Kiu-la-ta), Satadra (Shete-to-lu) and Paryatra (Po-li-ye-to-to). An interesting custom of making offerings in honour of the disciples of the Buddha is said to have prevailed in Mathura. The followers of Abhidhamma made offerings in honour of Sāriputta, those who practised meditation....... in honour of Maudgalyāyana, the students of the sutras...... in honour of Purnamaitrāyaniputra, the followers of the Vinaya..... in honour of Upāli, the bhikkhunis..... in honour of Ananda, the Srāmaneras.... in honour of Rāhula and followers of the Great Vehicle.... in honour of bodhisattvas (Watters, pp. 302, 303; The Life, p. 77).<br>After Mathura he visited Matipuram (Ma-ti-pu-lo) which was ruled by a king of the Sūdra caste. He makes reference to Gunaprabha the author of Tattvavibhaṅga Sāstra and to a learned doctor called Sanghabbadra who was versed in the Vibhāsā of the Sarvistivāda school and who composed the Kosa-kārikā. Ht. stayed there for a few months and studied various texts under the eminent monk called Mitrasena.<br>On his way to Kapitha (Kis-pi-tha) also called Sankassa he had to go past Brahmapura (P’o-lo-hih-mo-pu-lo), Ahikshetra (’O-hi-shi-to-lo) and Virāsana (Pi-to-shanna). Proceeding two hundred li towards north-west from Kapitha he reached Kanauj or Kānyakubja (Kie-jo-kio-she-kwo). Its capital borders on the Ganges on the West.<br>Watters argues that the direction shown in the text is wrong and it should be South East. He also argues that the river in question is not the Ganges but a tributary of that river (Waiters, p. 340; cp. also Records, Bk. V. p. 207.<br>It was a busy centre of Buddhism and there were ten thousand monks who studied both vehicles very ardently. His account on Harsavardhana or Harsha also called Silāditya is of immense historical value.<br>Countries from Ayodhyā (O-yo-t’o) to Hiranya parvata (I-lam-na-po-fa-to) constitute another phase of his long pilgrimage. Six hundred li to the south-east from Kanauj is Ayodhya. Several thousand monks there studied both vehicles, and it is here that Vasubandhu and Asaṅga carried out their literary activities. When Ht. and his companions were going from Ayodhya to Hayamukha (’O-ye-mu-khi) along the course of the Ganges a gang of pirates took the crew captive. As worshippers of goddess Durga the pirates were looking out for a man of good form and comely features for sacrificing to the goddess. They earmarked Ht. as the most suitable person for the purpose and were about to kill him. Suddenly a typhoon arose smiting down the trees. Clouds of sand flew on every side and the lashing waves of the river tossed the boats to and fro. The pirates getting terrified at the calamity thought that it all happened due to the spiritual power of Ht, and came down in repentance and confessed their fault.<br>After this nasty experience Ht. went to Hayamukha and from there to Prayāga (Po-lo-ye-kia). He describes Prayāga, the confluence of two rivers, Gangā and Yamunā and the level ground of about fourteen li in circuit, to the West. From Prayāga he set out for Kausambi (Kiau-shang-mi) where he saw many saṅghāramas, stūpas and a sandalwood image of the Buddha fashioned by king Udayana. According to Ht, there were about three thousand monks belonging to the Sammitiya school of the Little Vehicle in the Kingdom of Visākha (Pi-so-kia).<br>In Srāvasti, the next important Buddhist centre he visited, there were several hundred saṅghārāmas belonging to the Sammitiya school. Sites connected with various incidents are described: for instance, the spot on which Angulimāla gave up his evil acts and was converted, the convent where Brahmacāri heretics killed a woman and accused the Buddha of her murder, the venue in which the Buddha defeated all the heretics, the place where the Buddha met his father, king Suddhodana, for the first time since Enlightenment and so on.<br>From Srāvasti he went to Kapilavastu (Kie-pi-lo-fa-sutu) where the capital as well as some thousand villages were in a state of ruin. There he saw old foundations of the main palace of Suddhodana and the sleeping quarters of Queen Māyā etc. Hsūan-tsang’s account of Kapilavastu and Kusinagara (Kushi-na-kie-lo) or Kusinārā is replete with accounts of the life of the Buddha before and after his Enlightenment, for example the place of his birth, prophetic pronouncement, sites of the Four Signs, Parinirvāna etc. According to Ht. the contemporary tradition has it that the Buddha’s Nirvina’ took place on the fifteenth day of the latter half of the month of Vaisākha. The Sarvāstivādins held that it took place during the second half of the month of Kārtika i.e. November.<br>Referring to the kingdom of Banaras or Bārānasi (Po-lo-ni-sse) he speaks of two schools of monks, one belonging to the Sarvāstivāda and the other to the Sammitiya school both belonging to the Little Vehicle. Important sites such as the venue of the Buddha’s first sermon and his washing tank are mentioned in his account.<br>From Bārānasi he went to Ghazipur (Chen-chu) and then to Vaisāli. There the capital city was in a state of devastation and ruin. The inhabitants at the time of his visit were very few in number. In a saṅghārāma there the Buddha is said to have recited the Vimalakirti Sutra. Three important places relating to his Parinirvana are also mentioned.<br>On his way to Magadha (Mo-kie-to) he stopped at the town of Svetapura where he obtained the sūtra called the Bodhisattva-pitaka. He had a high esteem for the people of Magadha. According to him there were about ten thousand monks mostly belonging to the Great Vehicle in Magadha. The capital of Magadha was desolate and in ruins. According to Ht. Asoka held a convocation of a thousand monks at a monastery called Kukkutārāma. This is an allusion to the Third Council held under the patronage of King Asoka. The monastery in question is named as Asokārāma in the Dipavamsa and the Mahāvamsa, the two ancient Pali chronicles of Sri Lanka.<br>Referring to Nairañjāna and other important sites at Bodhgayā he mentions various beliefs regarding the Vajrāsana. One such belief holds that the site of the Vajrāsana was the centre of the universe. He says that the Bo-tree had been continually cut down and destroyed by the members of the royalty. Elsewhere he refers to one king named Sasānka of Karnasuvarna in Eastern India who destroyed the Bo-tree (Records Bk. viii, p. 121). The following account of Ht. regarding the Bo-tree seems interesting in respect of rituals which developed in later times. ”The Bo-tree sheds its leaves when the day of the Nirvana approaches and tender leaves begin to grow after this day. Every year on that day kings, ministers and magistrates pour milk on its roots, light lamps, scatter flowers and they go away collecting leaves.<br>The account on the Nālandā monastery gives some idea about its academic activities, maintenance, academic staff and student population, curriculum and residential quarters. It says that after the ”Nirvana” of the Buddha an old king of that country called Sakrāditya built this convent out of his great attachment for the Buddha. By the time of Ht.’s visit it had been about 700 years since its establishment. Thus its founding dates back to 1st century B.C.<br>His purpose of going to Nālandā was to learn the principles of the Yoga-sastra, The chief monk Silabhadra admitted Ht. as his disciple. Among the students there were many foreigners. According to Ht. of all the saṅghārāmas of India Nālandā Monastery was the most remarkable for its grandeur and height. Resident students numbered ten thousand. They studied the teachings of all the eighteen schools and also subjects such as the Vedas, the Hetuvidyā, Sabdavidyā, the Cikitsāvidyā, the works on magic (Atharvaveda) and the Sānkhya system. There were 1541 scholars who were versed in various branches of study. Within the temple hundred pupils were being arranged every day for preaching and students attended these and participated in discussions without fail.<br>As for the source of income of the Nālandā monastery Ht. tells us that there was a farm-house belonging to the monastery. The account does not say anything about the way in which the farm was run and how the income accrued to the monastery. There were other sources of income too. According to Ht. the king of the country remitted the revenue of about hundred villages for the endowment of the convent. Two hundred house holders in these villages contributed rice, butter and milk daily. Hence students had no complaints to make about their requisites.<br>In Rājagrha he locates many important sites connected with various episodes; for instance, the site of the stupa where Devadatta in conjunction with Ajātasatru rājā let loose the drunken elephant with intent to kill the Buddha. Referring to the Grdhrakūta (Ki-li-to-lo-kiu) it is said that while residing there the Buddha declared the Saddharmapundarika (Fa-hwa), the Mahāprajñā (Tapan-jo) and numerous other Sutras.<br>His account on the First Council held in Rājagrha is rather misleading. It appears that he has incorporated into it certain details which deal with later councils. According to Ht. the collection of scriptures authorised by the Council came to be called Sthavira collection because Kāsyapa (Mahā Kassapa) officiated as the president of the assembly. As regards the emergence of the Mahāsanghika school Ht. informs us that monks who were excluded from the Council held by Mahā Kāsyapa assembled in Rājagrha and made a collection of the doctrine in five Pitakas, the Sutra Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the Miscellaneous Pitaka and the Dhārani Pitaka. How this assembly got the name Mahāsanghika is explained as follows: ”As in this assembly there were ordinary persons (Fan-fu) and holy men it was called the Convocation of the Mahāsanghikas (The Life, p. 117 cp. Dipavamsa, H. Oldenberg, New Delhi, 1982, 5,30).<br>Having visited sacred places in the vicinity of Nālandā Ht. returned to the Nālandā Monastery again and studied several texts such as the Yoga-sastra, the Nyāyānusārasastra, the Hin-hiang-tui-fa-ming, the Hetuvidyā-sastra, the Prānyamūla-sastra-tīkā and the Sata-sastra. Although he had studied the Kosa-vibhāsā and the Satpadābhidharma-sastra in different parts of Kashmir yet he studied them again at Nālandā Monastery. He also studied Brahman literary works and a grammatical treatise the author of which is not known. On the task of studying the Buddhist and Brahman texts he spent five years.<br>The next country he visited was Hiranyaparvata (I-lanna-po-fa-to) where he stayed for one year and read the Vibhāsā and the Nyāyānusāra-sastra etc. From Hiranyaparvata he made his way to the kingdom of Champa where monks followed the Little Vehicle. This country was infested with wild beasts such as the elephant, wolf, rhinoceros and black leopard. Elephants in that country were used for drawing carriages.<br>Countries between Champa (Chen-po) and Samaṭaṭa (San-to-ch’a) form another phase of his long journey. He visited Hiranya, Kajughira (Ki-shu-ko-kie-lo), Pundravardhana (Pu-na-fa-tan-na) Karnasuvarna (Kielo-na-su-fala-na) before arriving at Samaṭaṭa. Monks in Pundravardhana belonged to both vehicles whereas those in Karnasuvarna belong to the Little Vehicle of the Sammitiya school. Monks in Karnasurvarna did not use either butter or milk in keeping with the traditional teachings of Devadatta. Immediately after his account on Samaṭaṭa he refers to Pegu and Siam which, however, lay outside his itinerary.<br>Countries included in his itinerary in the East and South-east of India were Tāmralipti (Tan-mo-li-ti), Orissa, Kalinga (Kie-ling-kia), Southern Kosala (Kiao-sa-lo), Andhra (An-to-lo), Dhanakataka (To-na-kie-tse-kia) and Chulya. All these countries had centres of Buddhism. He refers to an entrepot called Caritra (Chi-li-ta-lo) situated on the South-eastern frontier of Orissa.<br>Dhanakataka, according to Ht. was once a reputed centre of learning, and learned men used to come and dwell there but at the time of his visit it was entirely desolate.<br>The Kingdom of Chulya may be identified with the Cola Kingdom. He locates the Chulya Kingdom outside the Dravida country. What made him follow this description is not clear. The Cola Kingdom formed part of the Dravida country through the ages.<br>The next place he visited was the Kingdom of Dravida. The territory occupied by Dravida people could have consisted of several kingdoms or countries, but Ht. refers to it as forming one kingdom. However, the capital of that kingdom is named Kanchipura, the birth place of Dharmapāla Bodhisattva.<br>Whilst in Kanchipura Ht. met some three hundred monks from Sinhala. They informed him of the unsettled situation prevailing in Sri Lanka at the time. This dissuaded him from going there. His purpose of going to Sinhala was to get the Tripitaka explained according to the Sthavira school there and also to study the Yoga Sāstra.<br>Malakūta was the next important place he visited. He refers to Malayagiri which was well-known for sandalwood and the karpūra scented tree. After Malakūta (Mole-kiu-ch’a) he refers to Sinhala again. According to Ht. Sinhala was originally called Po-chu as it had many gems of a rare character. As for the origin of the Sinhala he narrates with slight variations the legend which traced the origin to a lion king and the murder of the lion by his son. According to Ht. it was the son of the lion who arrived in Po-chu and not his grandson Vijaya as recorded in Sri Lankan chronicles. A second theory about the origin of the Sinhala is narrated as follows: ”But it is also said that Sinhala is the name of a merchant’s son, who...... came to Po-chu island and slew the Rakshasas and established his capital in the country.<br>With regard to the teachings prevailing in Sri Lanka he adds that monks there follow the teachings of the Great Vehicle and they belong to the school of the sthaviras. He also refers to the schism which resulted in the division of the Sangha into two factions, the Mahāviharavāsins who were opposed to the Great Vehicle and the Abhayagirivāsins who studied both vehicles. His reference to a mountain named Lankāgiri may be the Samantakūta (Adam’s Peak) and it was on that mountain the Tathāgata delivered the Lankāvatāra Sutra according to Ht.<br>Going two thousand li from Dravida he arrived at Konkanpura (Kin-na-po-lo) and from there to Maharashtra, He tells us that in a vihāra at Konkanpura there was a precious head-dress of Prince Siddhārtha. With reference to Maharashtra he says that the people of that country were a warlike nation. He cites in evidence the unsuccessful attempt of Silāditya rājā to subjugate Pulakesin. This king may be identified as Pulakesin II (609-642 A.C) of the Chalukyas of Vatapi in the Bijapur District.<br>Among the countries included in his itinerary to the West and North-west of Narmada were Broach (Baroche), Mālava (Mo-la-po), Brāhmanapura (K’ie-ch’a), Vallabhi (Fa-la-pi), Anandapura, Surāshtra (Lasn-c’ha) Gurjjara (Kiu-che-lo), Ujjayin (U-che-yen-na), Chi-ki-to, Mahesvarapura, Surātha, Atyanabakela (O-tin-p’o-chi-lo) and Laṅgala (Lang-kie-lo). The last country is situated near the Great Sea towards the country of western women. If Mālavas were the people of Malava or Malwa in Central India as is generally taken the countries named about are not placed in right order. Ujjayini which is the capital of Malwa is named after Surashtra and Gurjjara situated in Gujarat.<br>Of all the countries in India, Ht. had a very high opinion of Mālava and Magadha. He says that people of these two countries had the reputation of loving the study of literature, of honouring virtue, of polite language and refined speech. In Mālava there were twenty thousand monks studying the teaching of the Sammitiya school of the small vehicle.<br>We are told that going north-west from Langāla he went to Persia (Po-la-sse) which, lay outside India. It is said that the bowl (patrā) of the Sakyamuni Buddha was in the royal palace of the country. On its frontier is the city of Ormus (Ho-mo). The countries mentioned next are Babylon? (Fo-lin), an island called the country of the Western women, which is tributary to Fo-lin, Laṅgala, Pitasila (Pi-to-shi-lo), Avanda, Sindh (Sin-tu) Mūlasthānapura or Multan (Mu-lo-s’an-po-la) and Parvati.<br>If Avanda is to be identified with Avanti in Central India which seems probable in view of his desçriptions of that country, it is difficult to place Avanda on the route followed from Laṅgala to Multan.<br>The country called Parvata was noted for renowned scholars. Ht. stayed there for two years and studied the Mūlābhidharma-sastra, the Saddharma-samparigrahasāstra and the Prasiksāsatya-sāstra as preserved in the Sammitiya school.<br>From Parvata he returned south-eastwardly to Magadha and from there to the Nālandā Monastery. There was in Nālandā a renowned monk called Prajñabhadra who was versed in the Three Pitakas, Sāstras etc. Ht. remained there for two years and had his doubts cleared through discussions. He spent two more years studying several branches of study under a renowned lay scholar named Jayasena.<br>He is said to have been apprised of the time for his return journey in a dream by Maitreya Bodhisattva. However, he was delayed due to unavoidable circumstances. In the meantime, Silabhadra, the master of sastras at Nālandā deputed Ht. to expound to the congregation there the Mahāyāna-samparigraha-sastra and to comment on the difficult points of the Vidyā-mātra-siddhi-sastra.<br>About this time Simharasmi and Ht. held two different views about the principles of Yoga. Ht. proved more competent in the encounter and composed a sastra in three thousand slokas resolving the controversy. This work was later approved for study. At this time further disputes took place between the adherents of the two vehicles.<br>Monks in Orissa belittled the Great Vehicle and were used to calling it ”Sky Flowers”. But the king of that country had a high regard for the Great Vehicle and challenged the authority of the critics. Monks thereupon requested the king to hold a conference at which they would settle the issue. The controversy does not appear to have taken place at a conference as expected but it came to an end with the compilation of a book which was written by Ht. in refutation of the heretical views held by the monks of Orissa. The way he refuted heretical views made his fame so widespread that king Kumārarāja of Karnasuvarna in Eastern India longed to have him as his spiritual head in his kingdom. When Ht. showed his reluctance for the third time the king turned furious and even went to the extent of threatening that he would destroy the whole of Nālandā Monastery in case his request was turned down. Although at last Ht, complied with the request of the king, Silāditya rāja’s intervention enabled him to get out of another embarrassing situation.<br>Silāditya rāja on his part made arrangements to hold a conference for the exposition of the Great Vehicle and to refute the views of the followers of the Little Vehicle. Princes of eighteen countries were invited to participate in the conference. Renowned Buddhist monks, celebrated Brahmans, heretics, non-believers and secular persons attended the conference. For five days Ht. extolled the teachings of the Great Vehicle and no opponent had any opportunity to assert his views. Adherents of the Little Vehicle learning that their school was shattered plotted to kill him. The king, however, threatened to behead any one who made an attempt on the life of Ht. It is said that, at the end, large multitudes forsook the Little Vehicle and embraced the Great-Vehicle. When the conference was over Ht. made up his mind to go back to his country. But on a request made to him by Silāditya to witness the quinquennial distribution called ’Mahā moksa parisad’ he had to postpone for ten days his return journey.<br>For his return journey Ht. chose to follow the northern route in order to keep the pledge made by him to the king of Kan-chang that he would visit him on his way back. Getting out from the city of Prayāga he took the route which lay across Kausambi, Jalandhara, Simhapura, Taksasilā and the river Indus. The boat laden with ola manuscripts and flower seeds capsized in the Indus and fifty manuscript copies and flower seeds were lost. From there he went past Lamghan (Lan-po), Varna, Avakan, the snowy mountains, Kunduz (Hwoh), Tukhara, Kuran, Bolor and Kashgar up to Khotan.<br>Of these countries Kashgar and Khotan were renowned centres of the Great Vehicle. Whilst in Khotan he states that he accomplished a journey of more than 50,000 li. His journey through various kingdoms took seventeen years. Here he faced the problem of transporting his books, images and such articles and sent a messenger to Kau-chang asking for help. Seven or eight months later transport facilities were arranged.<br>Among the books he brought were 224 sutras and 192 sāstras of the Great Vehicle; 15 works of the same categories belonging to the Sammitiya School; 22 books of the same belonging to the Mahisāsaka school; 67 books.... of the Sthaviravādin school; 17 works.... of the Kāsyapiya school; 42 works..... of the Dharmagupta school; 36 copies of the Hetuvidyā Sāstra; 13 copies of the Sabdavidyā sastra. Altogether there were 520 copies comprising 657 volumes carried upon twenty horses.<br>Then he set upon the gigantic task of translating these books into Chinese. For carrying out this project he retired to the monastery of Hong-fu in Si-gan-fu. He completed the translation of 74 distinct works having 1335 chapters. He had moreover made a vast number of pictures and wrote with his own hands copies of various sutras. When all these works had been finished he closed his eyes and lay perfectly still. ”Having recited some verses in adoration of Maitreya, he gradually sank until the day of his demise on the 10th March, the 13th day of the year 664.”<br>Hsūan-tsang’s travel accounts which appear in the foregoing description furnish information on a wide variety of subjects. Some of these such as physical barriers, the relative distribution of the centres of the Little and the Great Vehicle in and outside India, Buddhist monuments, hospitality shown in different countries, conferences, religious encounters have been surveyed in brief in the above account. Apart from these he presents a wealth of information on a wide range of subjects such as economic, educational and social conditions, religious practices, mannerism, customs administration and so on. He enumerates a number of ways of showing respect and paying homage that was prevalent among the people of India. Some such forms are<br>(i) greeting with a kind of enquiry; (ii) reverently bowing the head; (iii) raising the hands to the head with an inclination of the body; (iv) bowing with hands folded on the chest; (v) bending a knee; (vi) kneeling down; (vii) going down on the ground on hands and knees; (viii) bowing down with knees, elbows and forehead to the ground and (ix) prostrating oneself on the ground.Regarding the general education meant for Indians he describes that children in the beginning followed the ’Twelve Chapters’ and at the age of seven they began to study the great treatises of the ’Five Sciences’. Some idea of Buddhist education may be gained from his description of Nālandā referred to earlier, But his estimation of the Brahmanic system of educating beginners is very high. Regarding the Brahmanic teachers he says: ”These teachers explain the general meaning and teach them minutely, they rouse them to activity and skilfully win them over to progress, they instruct the inert and sharpen the dull. When disciples intelligent and acute are addicted to idle shirking the teachers doggedly persevere repeating instruction until their training is finished.....”<br>Ht. states that differences among various schools of Buddhism were seen in their tenets and also in customs. According to Ht. different schools had their own tenets, and controversies ran high. As a result each of the eighteen schools claimed that each system was intellectually superior to others. Tenets of the Great and the Little systems differed widely. Certain concessions and gains were accorded to monks in keeping with their knowledge and where the spiritual attainments were high the distinctions conferred were extraordinary.<br>Referring to the three robes allowed for monks as their costume he narrates that different schools adhered to different styles having broad or narrow fringes and small or large folds. Ht.’s description about wearing saṅghāti (seng-kio-ki) conforms to the present day practice of its wearing by monks in Sri Lanka and other Theravāda countries. As for the antaravāsa, (ni-po-so-na) the undergarment, he says that it was worn without a belt. Rather it was made into plaits and then secured by one of these plaits.<br>Regarding social organisation Ht. informs us that society consists of four caste groups. These four castes form classes of various degrees of ceremonial purity. The members of a caste marry within the caste. Relatives whether by the father’s or mother’s side do not intermarry and a woman never contracts a second marriage.<br>Speaking about the character of the Indian people he tells us that they were of hasty and irresolute temperament but of pure moral principles. They fear retribution for sins in future lives and take lightly their plight in the present life. They keep their sworn obligations.<br>His account on law and punishment too, is interesting. According to him the offenders who violate statute law were imprisoned for life. For offences against social morality, disloyalty and unfilial conduct the punishment was mutilation or banishment of the offender out of the country or into the wilderness. Other offences can be atoned for by paying a fine. He also describes the four ordeals by which the innocence or guilt of an accused person is determined.<br>For offences against the Vinaya, the community of brethren has a gradation of penalties. If the offence was slight a reprimand was ordered and the punishment became harsh according to the gravity of the offence. Expulsion from the community was the worst punishment meted out to the most serious offender.<br>As for the disposal of the dead and the performance of the last rites, there were three recognised customs. The first of these was cremation. The second was water burial, the corpse being put into a stream to float and dissolve. The third was burial in the wilderness, the body being cast away in the woods to be eaten up by wild animals.<br>The Buddhist brethren were forbidden to wail aloud over a departed one. On the death of a parent they read a service of gratitude to secure for the deceased person bliss in the next life.<br>If we are to depend on the records left by Ht. certain kings of the Gupta dynasty have patronised Buddhism. According to him Purugupta Vikrama Prakāsāditya, a brother of Skandagupta, Narasimhagupta Balāditya, son and successor of Purugupta, Tathāgatarāja Vainyagupta, another son of Purugupta and Vajira, a son of Narasimhagupta Balāditya patronised Buddhism. All these kings contributed to the promotion of Buddhist learning by building monastic establishments at Nālandā.<br>According to Ht. the worship of relics was widely practised in many Buddhist countries traversed by him and among these the most popular was the cult of the Tooth Relic of the Buddha. It was prevalent in Bhaktra; in an unnamed temple of a small valley situated to the east of the snowy mountain; Kashmir and Simbala. The next popular Buddhist cult was that of the Bowl-relic.<br>Purusapura, the capital of Gandhāra as well as Persia are mentioned as countries where the Bowl-relic was venerated. The following objects too were venerated: the sweeping brush made of kusa grass in Bhaktra, the skull-bone at Hidda (Kilo of Fa-hsien) in Nagarahara (Jelalabad), the eye ball, the saṅghāti robe, and the staff at the same site and the garment washing stone obtained in Udyāna. A strong tradition about the Buddha presenting pieces of his nails and some hair to two merchants who offered him honey and rice cake is recorded by Ht. with regard to Bhaktra (The Life p.50). This is evidently based on the account in the Vinays Mahāvagga where two merchants play a similar role at Bodh Gaya though no reference is made there to the presentation of nails to them.<br>On his way to India he passed through countries where Buddhism did not have adherents. Two such countries were Kan-chang and Sa-mo-kien. He succeeded in propagating Buddhism in those countries by delivering effective sermons. In the latter some devotees were so taken up with the teachings that they even entered the Buddhist Order. It was partly due to his evangelist endeavours that Buddhism which lay dormant after the age of the Guptas began to flourish during the reign of Harshavardhana.<br>(Picture of Hiuen Tsiang).'],

'iccānanagala':['A brahmin village in the Kosala country. It was while staying in the woodland thicket (vanasanda) there that the Buddha preached the Ambattha Sutta (D.3). From this sutta, the village would seem to have been near Pokkharasādi’s domain ofUkkatthā. It was the residence of ”Mahāsāla” brahmins. The Sutta Nipāta (p.115) (which spells the name as Icchānankala) mentions several eminent brahmins who lived there, among themCankī, Tārukkha,Pokkarasāti, Jānussoni and Todeyya.<br>There were also two learned youths, Vāsettha and Bhāradvāja at Icchānankala, who, finding it impossible to bring their discussion to a conclusion, sought the Buddha, then staying in the village. Their interview with the Buddha is recorded in theVāsettha Sutta (Ibid., 115ff.; M ii.146ff).<br>Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.462) says that learned brahmins of Kosala, deeply versed in the Vedas, were in the habit of meeting together from time to time (once in six months, MA.ii.796) at Icchānaṅgala in order to recite the Vedas and discuss their interpretation. These brahmins met at Ukkatthā, under Pokkharasāti, when they wished to cleanse their caste (jātisodhanattham), and at Icchānankala in order to revise their Vedic hymns (mante sodhetu-kāmā), MA.ii.796.<br>According to the Samyutta Nikāya (v.325), the Buddha once stayed for three months in the jungle thicket at Icchānaṅgala, in almost complete solitude, visited only by a single monk who brought him his food. But from the Anguttara Nikāya (iii.30f.; cf. iii.341 and iv.340ff), it would appear that the Buddha was not left to enjoy the solitude which he desired, for we are told that the residents of Icchānaṅgala, having heard of the Buddha’s visit, came to him in large numbers and created a disturbance by their shouts.

In the first year of his reign he incurred the displeasure of the powerful Lambakannas and was deprived of his throne and taken captive. It is said that the king was rescued from prison by his state elephant and that he escaped to Rohana. Three years later he gave battle to the Lambakannas at Kapallakkhanda and massacred most of them. He had the noses and toes of the rest cut off as punishment.<br>He was succeeded by his son Candamukha Siva. To his state elephant, who had helped him, he gave the tract of land called Hatthibhoga. During his exile in Rohana, Ilanaga built two tanks, the Tissa and the Dūra, and restored the Nāgamahāvihāra, which he gave to Mahāpaduma, thera of Tulādhāra, who had preached to him the Kapi Jātaka. He also gave land for its maintenance. Mhv.xxxv.14-45; Dpv.xxi.41f.'],
'ilankiya':['A Damila chieftain of South India, conquered by Parakkamabāhu I. (Cv.lxxvi.98). Later, Ilankiya became the ally of Parakkamabāhu, who gave him earrings and other ornaments as a mark of royal favour, also conferring on him the coveted title of Rājavesibhujaṅga-Silāmegha. Ibid., 191-2; on the title see Geiger, Cv. Trs.ii.10, n.3.'],
'illisa':['A setthi of Rājagaha. At the opening of the story the king of Benares is mentioned, but it is to Rājagaha that Sakka comes (see p.350), so Rājagaha was evidently Illisa’s residence.<br>He was lame and hunch-backed and also had a squint. He was an infidel and a miser, never giving away any of his wealth nor enjoying it himself.<br>For seven generations his ancestors had been generous, but Illisa burnt down the almonry and drove away the poor from his house.<br>Once, at the sight of a yokel drinking, with a piece of dried fish as a relish, Illisa was sorely tempted to drink himself. For a long time he fought the temptation, but he sickened with longing, and having sent a slave with a single penny to the tavern, he got some toddy; he ordered the slave to put the jar of spirits in a thicket by the riverside so that he might drink unseen.<br>Meanwhile Illisa’s father, who had been born as Sakka, having learnt, as a result of investigations, that his son had become a miser, came down to earth to wean him from his folly. Assuming in every detail the form of Illisa, he entered the king’s palace and offered all the wealth of Illisa to the king. On the offer being refused, he went to Illisa’s house and gave orders to the servants to throw open all the treasure chambers and give the wealth to the poor. The servants took the disguised Sakka to be Illisa himself, and Illisa’s wife, believing her husband’s sudden generosity to be due to his drunkenness, acquiesced in the instructions.<br>Among those who profited by this unexpected good fortune was a countryman who had been Illisa’s carriage-driver. Filling the carriage with seven things of value, he set out along the road, passing by the thicket wherein Illisa lay drinking. The man was singing Illisa’s praises, and at mention of his name Illisa came out, and seeing the man going away with his belongings tried to stop him. But the man, not recognising him, knocked him down and went on his way. Illisa hurried home but was turned out of his house by the porters, and at length he sought the king. The king, having heard his story, made enquiries and discovered the existence of two Illisas, alike in every respect, down to the minutest detail, even to a wart on the head.<br>Not even Illisa’s wife and children, not even his barber, could distinguish him from the second Illisa.<br>Bereft of all hope, Illisa swoons, Sakka reveals himself and tells Illisa that the wealth is really his and not Illisa’s, the latter not having earned it. He urges Illisa to do good and practise generosity, or he would die, smitten by Indra’s thunderbolt.<br>Illisa, taking heed of the warning, becomes a virtuous man (J.i.349ff).'],
'illisa jātaka':['The story of Illisa. The Jātaka was related in reference to the conversion by Moggallāna of the banker Maccharikosiya of Sakkhara.<br>Illisa of the past is identified with Macchariyakosiya (J.i.345ff).<br>The story is given as an example of iddhi by means of which Moggallāna made a little thing increase manyfold. Vsm.ii.403.'],
'ina sutta':['Deals at length with the disadvantages, both material and moral, of poverty and consequent indebtedness. A.iii.351-4.'],
'iṇdagutta':['1. Indagutta.-A thera. He superintended the construction of the Mahāthūpa at Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxxviii.98; Dpv.xix.5, 6, 8). Dutthagāmaṇī consulted him with regard to all details and appointed him kammādhitthāyaka from the commencement of the work (MT.550f). He had great psychic powers, and at the festival of the dedication of the Thūpa he created a parasol of copper, as great as the universe, to ward off any harm that might befall those taking part in the celebrations (Mhv.xxxi.85). He was at the side of the king throughout the festival (Mhv.xxxi.105), and, by virtue of his power, all the inhabitants of Ceylon, who wished to worship the relics at the Mahāthūpa, were enabled to go to Anurādhapura the moment the wish to do so entered their hearts, and to return the same day (Mhv.xxxi.115).<br>This Indagutta is probably to be identified with the thera Indagutta, the head of a great parivena in Rājagaha, who came to Ceylon with eighty thousand monks to be present at the foundation-ceremony of the Mahāthūpa (Mhv.xxix.30).<br>2. Indagutta.-The thera appointed by the monks of Pātaliputta to superintend the work of building the eighty-four thousand vihāras undertaken by Asoka. The thera, by his power, made it possible for the dedication festivals of all the vihāras to be performed on the same day. Mhv.v.174; Sp.i.49.<br>Indagutta originally lived in Sīhakumbha-vihāra in Devaputta, at the head of a large congregation. Asoka, having heard of his fame, invited him to Pātaliputta. He went with 60,000 monks and Asoka received them with great honour. At the sight of the honours paid to him Indagutta was filled with pride. Asoka noticing this, admonished him. Indagutta benefiting by the advice, developed insight even as he stood and became an arahant. Ras.i.80f.'],
'indaka':['1. Indaka.-A yakkha who lived in Indakūta, near Rājagaha. When the Buddha was staying at Indakūta, the yakkha questioned him as to how the soul finds its material counterpart. The Buddha, in reply, described how the embryo evolved into its final shape by the laws of physical growth and not by a soul’s fiat (S.i.206).<br>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.231) that the yakkha was an animist (puggalavādin).<br>2. Indaka.-A deva. He had been a youth who gave a spoonful of food to Anuruddha. In consequence he was born in Tāvatimsa as a deva of great power and majesty. When the Buddha went to Tāvatimsa to preach the Abhidhamma, in the assembly of the gods who gathered there, those of lesser powers had to yield place to their superiors. Thus Ankura (q.v.), who, at the start, was very near the Buddha, found himself twelve leagues away. But not so Indaka; the power of his merit was very great and no deva was mighty enough to displace him; he had been lucky in the recipient of his gift. Ankura’s generosity, much more lavish than Indaka’s, had been bestowed on men who were not holy. Such was the explanation the Buddha gave in the assembly of the gods, on seeing the discrepancy between the positions of the two devas, Indaka surpassing the other in ten qualities. (Pv.pp.27f; PvA.136-8; DhA.iii.219-20; 80-1).<br>In one place, in the Petavatthu (p.28, v.69), Indaka is called a yakkha, but the Commentary (p.139) says it means deva-putta. He is, therefore, different from Indaka (1).<br>Indaka Sutta.-Contains the question asked by Indaka and the Buddha’s reply. (S.i.206).'],
'indakhīla sutta':['Like a tuft of cotton-wool or a ball of thistledown, wafted by every wind, are recluses and Brahmins who do not understand, as they really are, the facts of Ill; like an indakhīla, unshakable, unquakable, are those who do so understand. (S.v.443-5).'],
'indapatta':['A town in the Kuru country. In the Kurudhamma Jātaka (J.ii.365f; also J.iii.400; iv.361; v.457; vi.255; Cyp.i.3, v.1), Dhanañjaya Koravya, is mentioned as its king and as the owner of Añjanavasabha, the elephant of wondrous power.<br>The town was seven leagues in extent (J.v.57; 484) and there was a road that ran straight from Indapatta to Bārānasī (J.v.59).<br>In times past, Indapatta was considered one of the three chief cities of Jambudīpa, the others beingUttarapañcāla and Kekaka (J.ii.213, 214).<br>According to a verse found at the end of the Buddhavamsa (Bu.xxviii.11), the Buddha’s razor and needle were enshrined at Indapatta.<br>The modern Delhi stands on the site of Indapatta.'],
'indasama':['A king of thirteen kappas ago; a previous birth of Setuccha Thera (ThagA.i.207), also called Khajjakadāyaka (Ap.i.182).'],
'indasamānagotta':['A hermit who lived, with a large number of other anchorites, in the Himālaya. He had a young elephant which he had reared; being headstrong and rough in speech, he would not listen to the warning of his teacher, the Bodhisatta, that it was dangerous to have such a pet. Once while the hermits were away the elephant was seized with a frenzy, and when his master returned it killed him (J.ii.41-3).<br>Perhaps the man’s name was Kosiya, because we are told (J.vi.501) that Inda was of the Kosiyagotta.<br>Kātiyāna, who was a brahmin of the Kosiyagotta (ThagA.i.450), is addressed in a verse (416) of the Theragāthā as Indasagotta.'],
'indasamānagotta jātaka':['The story of Indasamānagotta, given above.<br>It was told in reference to an unruly monk, who is identified with the hermit of the Jātaka (J.ii.41ff).<br>For details see the Gijjha Jātaka.'],
'indasālaguhā':['A cave on the Vediya mountain, to the north ofAmbasandā, which was a brahmin village, east of Rājagaha.<br>Once, when the Buddha was staying there,Sakka visited him and asked him the questions recorded in the Sakkapañha Sutta (D.ii.263).<br>Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.697) that the cave lay between two overhanging rocks, with a large sāla-tree at the entrance. The village community had added walls with doors and windows and had ornamented it with polished plaster scroll-work and garlands and had presented it to the Buddha.<br>In Fa Hsien’s time (Giles, 48f), it was still inhabited and he describes it as being one yojana north-east of Nālandā.<br>Hiouen Thsang, however, found it deserted. He calls it Indraka-saila-gūhā (Beal ii.180-1).<br>Both pilgrims noticed marks on the rock; according to Fa Hsien they were the answers to Sakka’s questions written by the Buddha with his finger, while Hiouen Thsang says that both questions and answers were written on the stone.<br>The cave is identified with one about two miles to the south-west of the modern village of Giriyek. (CAGI. 539ff; Stein, Ind. Antiq. 1901, p.54).<br>It is said that on the occasion of the preaching of the Sakkapañha Sutta, eight hundred million devas realised the Truth (Mil.349).<br>See also Somanassa (3).'],
'indasālaka':['A cave, the size of a bed in a monk’s cell, near Vallipāsāna Vihāra.<br>It was the residence of Mahā-Nāgasena Thera.<br>When he was ill, eight thousand arahants and the inhabitants of the two deva worlds, led by Sakka, came to look after him. They all found room in the cave. MT.552.'],
'indriya jātaka':['Once an ascetic named Nārada, younger brother of Kāladevala, became a disciple of the Bodhisatta Jotipāla (also called in the story Sarabhaṅga), and lived in the mountainous country of Arañjara. Near Nārada’s hermitage was a river, on the banks of which courtesans used to sit, tempting men. Nārada saw one of these courtesans, and becoming enamoured of her, forsook his meditations and pined away for lack of food. Kāladevala, being aware of this, tried to wean him from his desires. Nārada, however, refused to be comforted, even when his colleagues, Sālissara, Mendissara and Pabbatissara admonished him. In the end Sarabhaṅga himself was summoned and Nārada, having listened to the words of his Master, was persuaded to give up his passion.<br>The story was told in reference to a backsliding monk. He went about for alms with his teachers and instructors but, being their junior, he received very little attention. Dissatisfied with his food and treatment, he sought his wife of former days. She provided him with every comfort and gradually tempted him with the desire to become a householder again. When the monk’s fellow-celibates discovered his wish, they took him to the Buddha who preached to him this Jātaka, showing that in a past life, too, he had been sorely tempted by the same woman. Nārada was identified with the backsliding monk and the courtesan with the wife of his lay-days (J.iii.461-9).<br>The Buddha is stated on this occasion to have preached also:<br>the Kandina Jātaka (J.i.153ff), the Rādha Jātaka (J.i.495ff), the Ruhaka Jātaka (J.ii.113ff), the Kanavera Jātaka (J.iii.58ff), the Asanka Jātaka (J.iii.248ff) and the Alambusā Jātaka (J.v.152ff).The Indriya Jātaka is also referred to in theKāmavilāpa Jātaka (J.ii.443ff), but the connection between the two stories is not clear; perhaps the reference is to another story of the same name.<br>See also Sarabhaṅga Jātaka.'],
'indriya sutta':['1. Indriya Sutta.-The monk possessed of six qualities - the five indriyas (saddhā, etc.), and the freedom of mind brought about by the destruction of the āsavas - is worthy of offerings, etc. A.iii.281.<br>2. Indriya Sutta.-Where control of the faculties of sense (indriya) is not found, morality ceases to exist and, in consequence, concentration, insight into and knowledge of reality as it is, detachment and the feeling of revulsion, insight into liberation - these also cease to exist. When such control is present all the other qualities are also present. A.iii.360.<br>3. Indriya Sutta.-If a monk, observing the rise and fall in the faculties of sense, is repelled by them and lusts not for them, the knowledge arises in him that he is free and that for him there is no hereafter.

'indriyabhāvanā sutta':['Preached at Kajaṅgalā in theMukheluvana. When a young brahmin,Uttara, pupil of Pārāpariya, visits theBuddha, the Buddha asks him what was the teaching of Pārāsariya on the development of the indriyas. It is that a man should neither see forms with his eyes, nor hear words with his ears, says Uttara. Whereupon the Buddha retorts that in that case the deaf and the blind have reached development. When Uttara sits silent and discomfited,Ananda intervenes and begs the Buddha to expound his teaching on the subject. The Buddha agrees and preaches this Sutta, with a variety of similes (M.iii.298-302).<br>In the Theragāthā Commentary (ii.17) we are told that theThera Pārāpariya (probably identical with Pārāsariya mentioned above) was taught the Indriyabhāvana Sutta by the Buddha. He learnt it by heart, and pondering over its meaning, attained insight. TheTheragāthā (vv.726ff) gives a summary of the musings of Pārāpariya which lead to his attainment.<br>The only connection between the Sutta and this summary is identity of subject, not identity of treatment. Perhaps Pārāpariya’s musings were only prompted by the Sutta and were independent of its actual words.'],
'indriyagocara sutta':['Mentioned in the Atthasālinī (pp. 307-8), Buddhaghosa’s Commentary on the Dhammasaṅgani.<br>The quotation given from it is: ”ekam mahābhūtam upādāya pāsādo pathavidhātuyā tīhi mahābhūtehi susaṅgahito āpodhātuyā ca tejodhātuyā ca vāyodhātuyā ca.” The sutta has, so far, not been traced elsewhere.'],

So she went to the Himālaya and having spread a bed of fragrant flowers, lay thereon and sang. Vessavana’s nephew, a Yakkha, Punnaka, heard her and offered himself as her husband. She took him to her father who agreed to give him Irandatī, if he could bring Vidhura’s heart. When Punnaka fulfilled this condition, as described in the Vidhura-paṇḍita Jātaka, Irandatī became his wife. J.vi.263-327.'],
'isayo araññakā':['Long ago, many seers of virtuous conduct lived in leaf huts in a wild forest. According to Buddhaghosa, they lived in the Himālays (SA.i.265); Vepacitti and Sakka were father- and son-in-law; sometimes they quarrelled, sometimes, as here, they were friends.<br>One day, Sakka and Vepacitti visited them. Vepacitti entered the hermitage by the principal gate, keeping his shoes on and his sword by his side, thereby insulting the seers and committing sin. Sakka, on the other hand, went in by the usual entrance, doffing his shoes and sword; with his canopy folded up, he stood to leeward of the seers, rendering them homage with clasped hands. The seers, addressing Sakka, asked him if he did not feel disgust at their smell, inasmuch as they were humans and he a god. Sakka answered that the scent of virtuous men is lovely, like unto a wreath of varied blossoms (S.i.226).'],
'isayo samuddakā':['Long ago, many virtuous seers lived in huts on the seashore. At that time there was a war between the gods and the Asuras. The seers considered the gods righteous but feared harm from the Asuras. They went, therefore, to Sambara, lord of the Asuras, and asked him for a pledge of safety; he refused, saying that the seers were followers of Sakka. The seers thereupon cursed him to suffer everlasting terror. It is said that that same night Sambara woke up thrice, seized with fright (S.i.227-8).<br>Buddhaghosa (SA.i.266) adds that as a result of this curse, Sambara’s mind became deranged and he came to be called Vepacitti (crazy-nerve).'],

'isidāsa':['A thera. He had a brother, also a monk, named Isibhatta. Having spent the rainy season in Sāvatthi, they went to take up their abode in a certain village. The people there gave them food and robes, but they refused to accept their share of these, because, according to the rule, the robes are the property of the Sangha until the Kathina-ceremony has been performed. The story is mentioned in connection with accepting robes elsewhere than in the spot where the rainy season has been spent. Vin.i.299.'],
'isidāsī therī':['She was the daughter of a good and wealthy merchant of Ujjenī. Having come of age, she was given in marriage to the son of a merchant in Sāketa.<br>For one month she lived with him as a devoted wife; then because of her past kamma, her husband became estranged from her, and turned her out of the house. She was married again with the same result, and a third time to a friar. Isidāsī’s father persuaded him to give up the pilgrim’s life; he dwelt with his wife only for a fortnight and refused to stay with her any more. Isidāsī then met the therīJinadattā, whom she entertained to a meal at her house. Under Jinadattā, Isidāsī joined the Order and became an arahant.<br>The Therīgāthā (vv.400-47), which contains forty-seven verses ascribed to her, describes not only her present life, but also her past lives. She had been a worker in gold in Erakaccha and had committed adultery in that life. As a result she was born in hell for a long time, and, in subsequent births became an ape, a goat, an ox, a hermaphrodite slave and a carter’s daughter. In this last birth she was sold to a merchant in payment of her father’s debts. When she was sixteen, the merchant’s son, Giridāsa, fell in love with her and married her. He had already one wife, and the new one caused dissension between her and her husband. Therefore it was that in this life she was hated by her husbands. This account of her sojourn in samsāra was related by Isidāsī in response to a request by one of her fellow-nuns, Bodhī (ThigA.260ff).<br>Mrs. Rhys Davids thinks (Sisters, Introd. pp.xxii f) that Isidāsī’s verses in the Therīgāthā suggest late literary craft and bear the impress of late literary creation. The scene is Pātaliputta, and not any of the usual towns mentioned in the Canon, and the name of Isidāsī’s sponsor – Jindattā - is, she says, significant. Perhaps there are traces here of Jainistic influence.<br>In the Dīpavamsa (xviii.9) Isidāsī (Isidāsikā) is mentioned in a list of eminent therīs who were leaders of the Order of bhikkhunis.'],
'isidinna':['A thera. He was the son of a setthi in Sunāparanta. He witnessed the miracle of the Buddha’s acceptance of the Candana-mālā (probably the Candanamālaka), and, having heard the Buddha preach, he became a Sotāpanna.

He entered the Order and soon after became an arahant (ThagA.i.312-3).<br>The Theragāthās (vv.187-8) contains two verses which he uttered in confessing aññā. They were the same as were spoken to him by his friendly spirit. In the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a householder and did homage to the Buddha’s Bodhi-tree with a fan made of sumana-flowers (ThagA.312f).<br>He is probably identical with Sumanavājaniya of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.415).'],

'isigili':['One of the five mountains round Rājagaha and one of the beauty-spots of the city (D.ii.116). There was, on one side of it, a black stone called the Kālasilā.

See e.g., Viii.ii.76, where Dabba Mallaputta is asked by monks to provide for them accommodation there; see also Vin.iii.41.<br>It was also the scene of the suicide of Godhika and Vakkali (S.i.121; iii.121f) and of the murder of Moggallāna by the brigands (J.v.125f; DhA.iii.65).<br>In the Cūla Dukkhakkhanda Sutta it is said that a large number of Niganthas lived at Kālasilā, never sitting down, undergoing paroxysms of acute pain and agony, following the teachings of Nigantha Nātaputta. The Buddha questioned them as to their practises and preached to them the above-mentioned Sutta, which he afterwards repeated to Mahānāma (M.i.91ff).<br>Once when the Buddha was dwelling at Kālasilā, he sang the praises of Rājagaha, giving Ananda a chance, if he so desired, of asking him to live on for a kappa; but Ananda did not take his opportunity (D.iii.116).<br>The books refer to several other visits of the Buddha to Isigilapassa. During one of these visits he heard Vangīsa’s high eulogy of Moggallāna (S.i.194; Thag.1249ff).<br>In the Isigili Sutta (M.iii.68-71) the Buddha is represented as saying that while the other mountains round Rājagaha - Vebhāra, Pandava, Vepulla and Gijjhakūta - had changed their old names, Isigili retained its former name and designation.<br>Five hundred Pacceka Buddhas once resided in Isigili for a long time; they could be seen entering the mountain, but once entered, there was no more sign of them. Men, observing this, said that the mountain swallowed up the sages and so it came by its name of Isigili (Isī gilatī ti = Isigili).<br>Buddhaghosa adds (MA.ii.889) that when the Pacceka Buddhas returned from their begging rounds, the rock would open like a folding door to admit them.

'issarasamāṇārāma':['One of the monasteries at Anurādhapura. It was built by Devānampiyatissa on the spot where the prince Arittha dwelt with his five hundred followers after having received their ordination from Mahinda (Mhv.xx.14; xix.66). The building of this monastery was the seventh of the great tasks performed by Devānampiyatissa (Mhv.xx.20).<br>One of the eight saplings from the Bodhi-tree at Anurādhapura was planted at Issarasamāṇārāma (Mhv.xix.61; Mbv.162).<br>Candamukha Siva built a tank near Manikāragāmaka and gave it for the use of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxv.47), while Vasabha built in the monastery an uposatha-hall (Mhv.xxxv.87) and Vohāraka Tissa constructed a wall round it (Mhv.xxxvi.36). Kassapa I. restored the buildings and enlarged the grounds. He also bought villages which he presented to the monastery for its maintenance. He had two daughters, Bodhī and Uppalavannā, and he gave their names and his own to the vihāra. When the king wished to hand over the vihāra to the Theravāda monks they refused to accept it, fearing the reproach of the people that it was the work of a parricide. Then the king dedicated it to the image of the Buddha and the monks accepted it saying that it belonged to their Master (Cv.xxxix.10-14; see also below).<br>According to the Mahāvamsa Tīkā (pp. 407 and 652), the vihāra was also called Kassapagiri, probably after its restoration by Kassapa I., mentioned above.’ See also Kassapagiri. See also Cv. Trs.i.43, n.7, and Ep. Zeyl. i.31ff., where the vihāra is called ”Isuramenu-.Bo-Upulvan-Kasubgiri” in an inscription of Mahinda IV.<br>It had originally been called Issarasamana because of its association with the five hundred noblemen (issaradārakā) who joined the Order with Arittha (MT.416). The Tīkā adds (607) that Sāliya, son of Dutthagāmāni, enlarged the vihāra out of the tribute brought to him by the men of his tributary villages to the south of Anurādhapura. He used to observe the uposatha on fast days at the vihāra and spend the day in the Mahindaguhā there.<br>In the Samantapāsādikā (i.100) the vihāra is called Issaranimmāna.'],
'issatta sutta':['Pasenadi questions the Buddha as to how gifts should be given and the Buddha’s answer is that they should be bestowed where the heart is pleased to give.

To the virtuous, irrespective of class, says the Buddha, and he instances the case of a youth skilled in war as opposed to one who is untrained and unskilled, no matter what his social status. The Buddha proceeds to describe the qualities which are possessed by the virtuous man (S.i.98f).<br>The Commentary (SA.i.129f) describes this interview as a public one, taking place before a large audience, among whom are teachers of rival schools, ”scratching the ground with their feet.” Their fame had suffered owing to the popularity of the Buddha and they had represented him as exhorting the people to give only to himself and to his followers. Pasenadi here gives the Buddha opportunity to vindicate himself.'],
'issāpakata':['The story of a woman who, finding that her husband had relations with a female servant, bound the servant hand and foot, cut off her nose and locked her up in a secret chamber. In order to hide the deed from her husband, she took him to the monastery to hear the Buddha preach. Some relatives of hers came to the house and discovering what had happened, released the servant. She went to the monastery where her mistress was listening to the Buddha’s sermon and proclaimed aloud the wrong done to her. The Buddha, thereupon, pointed out the folly of doing evil in the hope that it would not be found out. We are told that both the woman and her husband became Sotāpanna at the end of the sermon. The servant was set free (DhA.iii.486-7).'],
'issukī sutta':['A woman who is faithless, shameless, unscrupulous, envious and of weak wisdom is reborn in purgatory (S.iv.241).'],
'itivuttaka':['The fourth book of the Khuddaka Nikāya, containing 110 suttas, each of which begins with the words: vuttam h’etam Bhagavatā.<br>According to Dhammapāla (ItA.24ff), the suttas were preached from time to time by the Buddha to Khujjuttarā at Kosambī. She then repeated them to the five hundred women of Udena’s palace, chief of whom was Sāmāvatī. In order to emphasise to her audience the fact that she was reporting the Buddha’s words and not her own, she prefaced each sutta with the phrase quoted above. There was no need to describe any special circumstances in which the suttas were preached, because they were familiar to Khujjuttarā’s audience.<br>At the Rājagaha Council, Ananda repeated the suttas to the Assembly and they were gathered into this collection.<br>Itivuttaka is also the name given to one of the nine divisions (aṅga) into which the Buddha’s preaching is divided and it is defined as follows: vuttam h’etam Bhagavatā ti ādinayappavattā dasuttarasatam suttantā Itivuttakam ti veditabbam (DA.i.24).<br>In the scholiast of the Kummāsapinda Jātaka (J.iii.409; l.21)), the Itivuttaka is mentioned in the plural (Itivuttakesu) and a sutta is quoted from it, extolling the virtues of generosity. Perhaps, the Itivuttaka was compiled as a result of a critical study of the authentic teachings of the Buddha, considered in a certain light and made for a specific purpose.'],
'itthakāvati':['A village in Magadha, mentioned, together with Dīgharājī, as the residence of the Samsāramocaka heretics.

In the case of other monks, their minds abide in the release attained and stay fixed in the endeavour to destroy sakkāya - and they are like a man who grasps a branch with a clean hand. Some monks strive to destroy ignorance but are unsuccessful. Their minds are like a village pond (jambālī) which has stood for countless years with all its inlets blocked and outlets open and receiving no rain. There will be no breach in its dyke.

Parakkamabāhu II. also used Jambuddoni as his capital, but Vijayabāhu IV. moved the seat of government to Pulatthipura (Cv.lxxxx.13). Later, we find Bhuvanekabāhu I. being crowned in Jambuddoni, though his capital was in Subhagiri (Cv.xc.30). Vijayabāhu III. built the Vijayasundarārāma (q.v.) on Jambuddoni.'],
'jambudīpa':['One of the four Mahādīpas, or great continents, which are included in the Cakkavāla and are ruled by a Cakkavatti. They are grouped round MountSineru. In Jambudīpa is Himavā with its eighty-four thousand peaks, its lakes, mountain ranges, etc. This continent derives its name from the Jambu-tree (also called Naga) which grows there, its trunk fifteen yojanas in girth, its outspreading branches fifty yojanas in length, its shade one hundred yojanas in extent and its height one hundred yojanas (Vin.i.30; SNA.ii.443; Vsm.i.205f; Sp.i.119, etc.). On account of this tree, Jambudīpa is also known as Jambusanda (SN.vs.552; SNA.i.121). The continent is ten thousand yojanas in extent; of these ten thousand, four thousand are covered by the ocean, three thousand by the Himālaya mountains, while three thousand are inhabited by men (SNA.ii.437; UdA.300).<br>Sometimes in Jambudīpa there are as many as eighty-four thousand cities; this number is sometimes reduced to sixty thousand, forty thousand, or even twenty thousand, but never to less (SNA.i.59; J.iv.84 says sixty-three thousand; PvA.111). In the time of Asoka there were eighty-four thousand cities, in each of which he built a monastery (Mhv.v.176; Vsm.201). In the Anguttara Nikāya (i.35) it is said that, in Jambudīpa, trifling in number are the parks, groves, lakes, etc., more numerous the steep, precipitous places, unfordable rivers, inaccessible mountains, etc.<br>At the time of Metteyya Buddha’s appearance on earth Jambudīpa will be pervaded by mankind even as a jungle is by reeds and rushes. There will be eighty-four thousand cities with Ketumātī (Benares) at the head (D.iii.75).<br>The Buddha once declared that the people of Jambudīpa excel those of both Uttarakuru and Tāvatimsa in three respects - courage, mindfulness and religious life (A.iv.396; Kvu.99).<br>Buddhas (and Cakkavattis) are born only in Jambudīpa (BuA.48; MA.ii.917).<br>There were four sounds heard throughout Jambudīpa:<br>the shout uttered by Punnaka proclaiming his victory over Dhanañjaya Koravya in a game of dice; the bark of Vissakamma when taken about in the guise of a dog by Sakka, threatening to devour all wicked beings after the decay of Kassapa’s sāsana; the roar of Kusa, challenging to battle the seven kings who sought the hand of Pabhāvatī; the yell of āḷavaka, proclaiming his name from the top of Kelāsa, on hearing that the Buddha had visited his abode (SA.i.248, etc.).When opposed to Sīhaladīpa or Tambapannidīpa, Jambudīpa indicates the continent of India (E.g., Mhv.v.13; xiv.8; Cv.xxxvii.216, 246).<br>For the purposes of cārikā, the monks divided their tours in Jambudīpa into three circuits or mandalas - the Mahāmandala which extended over nine hundred leagues, the Majjhima which extended over six hundred, and the Antima over three hundred. Those who wish to tour the first, start after the mahāpavāraṇa and complete their journey in nine months, for the Majjhimamandala they start after the Pavāraṇa, on the full-moon day of Kattika, completing the tour in nine months, while for the Antimamandala they start on the first day of Phussa and return after seven months (Sp.i.197).<br>In each Cakkavāla there is a Jambudīpa (A.i.227). Mention is made in the Kākāti Jātaka (J.iii.91) of a Jambudīpa-samudda, beyond which was the river Kebuka.'],
'jambugāma':['A village, probably a suburb of Campā (see below), which the Buddha visited during his last tour. It lay between Ambagāma and Bhoganagara. D.ii.194.'],
'jambugāmika':['He was born at Campā, his father bearing the same name as himself. (He was probably chief of Jambugāma). He joined the Order and dwelt in the Añjanavana in Sāketa. One day, in order to test him, his father sent him a verse, and he, realising his imperfections, became an arahant (Thag.28; ThagA.i.86f).<br>In the time of Vessabhū Buddha he threw three kimsuka-flowers into the air as offering to the Buddha.<br>He is probably identical with Kimsukapupphiya of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.435; but see s.v. Somamitta.'],
'jambuka':['l. Jambuka Thera.-He was born in Rājagaha of rich parents but from infancy he would eat nothing but excrement. When he grew older he was ordained with the ājīvakas, who pulled out his hair with a palmyra comb. When the Ajivakas discovered that he ate filth, they expelled him and he lived as a naked ascetic, practising all kinds of austerities and accepting no offerings save butter and honey placed on the tip of his tongue with the point of a blade of grass. His fame spread far. When he was fifty-five years old, the Buddha visited him and spent the night in a cave near his abode. During the night, Jambuka saw mighty gods come to pay homage to the Buddha and was so impressed that the next day he sought the Buddha’s counsel. The Buddha told him of his past evil deeds which had condemned him to practise austerities for so long and counselled him to give up his evil ways. In the course of the sermon, Jambuka grew ashamed of his nakedness and the Buddha gave him a bath-robe. At the end of the discourse Jambuka became an arahant, and when the inhabitants of Anga and Magadha came to him with their offerings, he performed a miracle before them and paid homage to the Buddha, acknowledging him as his teacher.<br>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jambuka was a monk and had a lay patron who looked after him. One day a pious monk came to his vihāra, and the layman, being pleased with him, showed him much attention. The resident monk, very jealous, reviled the visitor, saying, ”It would be better for you to eat filth than food in this layman’s house, to tear your hair with a palmyra comb than let his barber cut it for you, to go naked than wear robes given by him, to lie on the ground than on a bed provided by him.” The Elder, not wishing to be the cause of his sinning, left the monastery the next day. Because of this act, the meditations practised by Jambuka for twenty thousand years were of no avail, and he was born in Avīci, where he suffered torments during an interval between two Buddhas. In this last life, too, he was condemned to suffer in many ways, as related above (DhA.ii.52-63; Thag.283-6; ThagA.i.386f).<br>In the time of Tissa Buddha he was a householder and made offerings at the Buddha’s Bodhi-tree, fanning the Buddha’s seat with a fan. He is probably identical with Sīhāsanavījanīya of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.403).<br>It is said (Mil.350; AA.i.57) that when the Buddha preached to Jambuka, eighty-four thousand others realised the Truth.<br>2. Jambuka.-A parrot, an incarnation of the Bodhisatta, adopted as his son by Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He preached to the king on the fivefold power - of limbs, of wealth, of counsel, of caste and of wisdom - the last being the best. The king thereupon appointed him commander-in-chief.

A sapling from the Bodhi-tree was afterwards planted on the spot where it had stood after landing (Mhv.vs.59; Sp.i.100; Mbv.145-62, passim) and Devānampiyatissa built a vihāra there called the Jambukolavihāra (Mhv.xx.25). From Jambukola to Tāmalitti by sea was a seven days’ voyage (Mhv.xi.23), and it appears to have taken five days to get to Anurādhapura from Jambukola (Mhv.vs.38).

For a long time she would not visit the Buddha, having heard that he spoke disparagingly of physical beauty, but one day, inspired by curiosity, she accompanied her colleagues to hear the Buddha preach. He, being aware of her thoughts, created the form of a most beautiful maiden who stood fanning him. As Janapadakalyāṇī sat gazing at her, enraptured by her beauty, she saw her gradually reach extreme old age, passing through all the stages, until at last she saw her die, leaving her body to decompose and become a mass of filth. At the critical moment, the Buddha uttered the appropriate words and Janapadakalyāṇī became a Sotāpanna. The Buddha then preached the Kāyavicchandanika Sutta and she became an arahant (Ud.iii.2; J.i.91; SNA.i.241f, 243f, 254, 273; DhA.i.97, 100).<br>She seems to have been known also as Rūpanandā.

The Buddha explains that this is but natural, old age being inherent in youth and decay and death being inevitable. S.v.216.'],
'jarudapāna jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once travelling with a large caravan. In a wood they came across a disused well and, needing water, dug it deeper. There they came across buried treasure, but the men, not being satisfied, dug deeper, in spite of the Bodhisatta’s warning.<br>A Nāga-king who lived there was disturbed and slew all except the Bodhisatta.<br>The story was related in reference to some arahants of Sāvatthi, who, on their way back from there, after having entertained the Buddha, saw the same well and found treasure there.

'jātika':['See Jatila (2).'],
'jaṭila':['l. Jatila.-A class of ascetics, so called on account of their matted hair (jatilā ti tāpasā, to hi jatādhāritāya idha jatilā ti vuttā) (UdA.74; see also 330). These ascetics are sometimes classed under isi (Culla Nid.149) and also under muni (Culla Nid.513).<br>2. Jatila.-A governor of a province (Mahāratthiya) in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. He was the Bodhisatta. v.l. Jatika. J.i.37; Bu.xi.11.<br>3. Jatila (v.l. Jatilaka).-A setthi ofMagadha, one of the five setthis ofBimbisāra (DhA.i.385). His mother was a setthi’s daughter in Benares, who had illicit relations with a Vijjādhara, and when the child was born she placed it in a vessel which she handed to her slave, to be floated down the Ganges. Two women, while bathing, saw the vessel, discovered what it contained and each claimed the child. The dispute was settled by the king and the child was given to the woman who happened to be a disciple of Mahā Kaccāna. The child was called Jatila because the first time he was bathed after birth his hair became matted. When able to walk, he was given to Mahā Kaccāna to be ordained, but the Thera took him to Takkasilā and handed him over to one of his supporters, a merchant, who adopted him as his son. Years passed, and one day the merchant, having to go on a journey, made a list of the goods which he had accumulated in his house during twelve years and asked Jatila to sell them if he could find buyers. Such was the lad’s fortune that in one day they were all disposed of. The merchant, realising the young man’s destiny, gave him his daughter in marriage and provided him with a house. As Jatila stepped into the house, the earth behind it was rent asunder and a mountain of gold, eighty cubits in height, appeared for his use. Thereupon the king made him a Treasurer. Later, wishing to retire from the world, Jatila sent out messengers to discover if there were others as rich as he, in case the king should raise objections to his going away. When news was brought back ofMendaka and Jotika, he knew there would be no opposition and obtained the king’s permission. He had three sons, but, having tested them, came to know that only the youngest had the necessary good fortune to enjoy his vast wealth. Jatila thereupon handed over to him his wealth and entered the Order, becoming an arahant within a few days. Some time afterwards the Buddha, with Jatila and other monks, was entertained for a fortnight by Jatila’s sons, and in answer to the monks’ questions Jatila declared that he felt no desire to re-enter household life. The monks found this hard to believe till assured by the Buddha that it was so.<br>In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jatila was a goldsmith. One day, an arahant, seeking for gold wherewith to complete the shrine erected over the Buddha’s remains, came to the goldsmith’s house; the latter, having just quarrelled with his wife, was in a surly mood and said to the arahant, ”Throw your teacher into the water and get away.” His wife told him how wicked were his words, and he, realising his fault, asked pardon of the arahant and made valuable offerings at the Buddha’s shrine, by way of amends. Of his three sons whom he asked, in turn, to help him with the preparations, only the youngest consented to go with him. Therefore it was that in seven successive states Jatila was thrown into the water on the day of his birth and only his youngest son could enjoy his wealth (DhA.iv.214ff; PsA.502f).<br>Jatila’s possession of a golden mountain is given as an example of puññiddhi, he being one of the five persons of great merit. Vsm.383; BuA.24.'],
'jaṭila sutta':['Once when Pasenadi was talking with the Buddha in the loggia outside the Migāramātupāsāda, there passed close by thirty-five ascetics of various denominations - Jatilas, Niganthas, etc. - and the king saluted them respectfully. Later, he asked the Buddha whether they were arahants or on the way to arahantship. The Buddha explained to him how hard it was for a layman, with all his encumbrances, to find an opportunity to learn the truth about arahants; much time and care and attention were necessary. The king agreed and mentioned how he gathered information through his spies. S.i.77f.'],
'jatukanni sutta':['Also called Jatukannimānavapucchā.<br>Contains the question asked of the Buddha by Jatukannī and the Buddha’s answer.<br>It is the eleventh sutta of the Parāyana Vagga.<br>SN.vv.1096-1100; SNA.ii.598; CNid.33ff.'],

When the king went to Anotatta, the Bodhisatta did him similar honour and friendship was established between them.<br>One day, two of the young geese, in spite of the advice of the Bodhisatta, wished to try their speed against the sun. Their king, wishing to save them from death, went with them, rescuing them when tired. Then he himself raced the sun and was victorious, arriving at the king’s palace.<br>The king, hearing of this, wished to see an exhibition of the Bodhisatta’s powers of speed, and his desire was granted. When asked whether anything was fleeter than himself, the king of the geese replied that the decay of the elements of life was a thousand-fold speedier.

On the death of Vijayabāhu, Jayabāhu became king with the help of the Pāndyan faction of the royal family and appointed, ”contrary to former custom,” Mānābharaṇa as his uparāja. The latter, however, seems to have been the virtual king; his attempts to attack Vikkamabāhu, the lawful uparāja, ended in disaster, and Vikkamabāhu captured the capital, Pulatthipura, whereupon Jayabāhu retired to Rohana.

'jayaddisa jātaka':['Twice the sons of Pañcāla, king of Kampilla, were devoured by an ogress who had conceived a hatred for his queen. On the third occasion the ogress was chased by the palace guard before she could eat the child, but she succeeded in snatching him away and brought him up as her own. He grew up to be a man-eating ogre and dwelt in a tree. The fourth son of Pañcāla was Jayaddisa, who succeeded his father.<br>The ogress had died before his birth. He had a son Alīnasattu.<br>One day Jayaddisa ordered a hunt, but just as he was about to start out, Nanda, a brahmin from Takkasilā, brought him four verses worth one hundred each. Jayaddisa ordered a dwelling to be made for him and declared that he on whose side the deer escaped should pay for the verses. An antelope made straight for the king and escaped. The king pursued and killed it, but while on his way back with the carcase he came to the ogre’s dwelling place and was promptly claimed as his prey. Remembering his promise to pay Nanda, Jayaddisa persuaded the ogre to let him go on condition that he would return when he had paid for the verses. Alīnasattu, hearing of this, offered to go in his father’s place and this was allowed. He won over the ogre by his fearlessness, taught him the moral law and, suspecting that the ogre was his father’s elder brother, proved the relationship with the help of an ascetic gifted with supernatural vision. Jayaddisa, informed of this, made a settlement for the ogre which came to be called Cullakammāsadamma.<br>The ogre was Angulimāla and Alīnasattu the Bodhisatta (J.v.21-30).<br>The story was related in reference to a monk who supported his mother; for details see the Sāma Jātaka.<br>The story of Jayaddisa is included in the Cariyāpitaka (ii.9).'],

He was a follower of the Buddha, of whom he was a great admirer. He appears to have been in the habit of talking to well known teachers of other schools and hearing their opinion of the Buddha, either for the purpose of comparing his own faith in him or of discovering their views. Two such conversations are recorded - one withSubha Todeyyaputta (M.ii.209), the other with Pilotika (M.i.175ff).<br>His discussion with Pilotika he reported to the Buddha, who expanded it to form the Culahatthipadopama Sutta.

The mistress of the house, not wishing to give, went in and returned saying she could not find any rice. The monk observed that there were other eatables in the house, and indicated to the woman, by means of a riddle, what he had seen.'],
'jātakaṭṭhakathā':['A Commentary on the Jātaka. It comprises all the verses of the Jātaka and gives also, in prose, the stories connected with the verses. Each such story is given a framework of introductory episode, stating the circumstances in which the story was related, and each story has at the end an identification of the chief characters mentioned with the Buddha and his contemporaries in some previous birth.<br>The whole collection is prefaced by a long introductory essay, the Nidānakathā, giving the Buddha’s history before his birth as Siddhattha, and also during his last birth, up to the time of the Enlightenment.<br>The work is a translation into Pāli of the commentary in Sinhalese as handed down in Ceylon, but the verses of this commentary were already in Pāli.<br>The authorship of the translation is traditionally attributed to Buddhaghosa, but there exists much difference of opinion on this point. For a discussion see P.L.C.123ff.'],

'jātipūjaka thera':['An arahant. On the day of Vipassī Buddha’s birth many miracles occurred, and soothsayers predicted that he would be a Buddha. Jātipūjaka, hearing this, offered him jasmine flowers. Three kappas ago he became king thirty-four times under the name of Supāricariya (Ap.i.154).<br>He is probably identical with Samitigutta.

See Angulimāla). He was intoxicated with pride over his own advantages, and one day, though visiting the Buddha, he decided not to speak unless the Buddha should address him first. The Buddha, reading his thoughts, preached a sermon, intended for him, on the evils of pride, and Jenta became a Sotāpanna. Later he entered the Order and became an arahant (Thag.vs.423-8; ThagA.i.455f). Perhaps he is to be identified with Manàtthaddha of the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.177; KS.i.224, n.1).'],

Aggabodhi fled to Jambudīpa, and Jetthatissa became king as Jetthatissa III. He reigned for only five months, during which time he did several meritorious works. Aggabodhi returned with an army, and in the battle which followed Jetthatissa slew himself at the sight of his army suffering defeat.

The Buddha suggests that now that he is very old he should give up wearing cast-off rag robes and dwelling in the forest, and should enjoy the gifts given to him by householders. Kassapa refuses to give up his long-established austere habits of life. Being asked the reason for this method of life, Kassapa answers that it is for his own happiness and out of compassion for those that come after (S.ii.202). The Commentary (SA.ii.128) adds that the Buddha asked the question in order to give Kassapa an opportunity for his ”lion’s roar” (Kassapa-sīhanāda).'],

'jīvaka sutta':['1. Jīvaka Sutta.-Jīvaka visits the Buddha who is staying in his Mangogrove, and asks if it is true that animals are slain expressly for the Buddha’s use. The Buddha replies that he forbids the eating of meat only when there is evidence of one’s eyes or ears as grounds for suspicion that the animal has been slain for one’s express use. Anyone who slays an animal for the use of a monk and gives it to him commits a great evil. Jīvaka is pleased with the reply and declares himself a follower of the Buddha. M.i.368f.<br>2. Jīvaka Sutta.-Questioned by Jīvaka, the Buddha explains that an upāsaka is one who has taken the Three Refuges and the Five Precepts, and that such a man, by reason of his qualities, works the welfare both of himself and others.

On a hill near the village Jotidāsa built a vihāra for Kassapa and provided him with the requisites. Moved by the Elder’s teaching, he left the world and soon after became an arahant. After ten years - during which he learnt the Three Pitakas, being specially proficient in the Vinaya - while on his way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha, he entered a Paribbājakārāma, and there had a discussion with the Paribbājakas on how to burn away evil. At the end of the discussion, they were ordained under him.<br>In the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a householder and, seeing the Buddha, offered him a kāsumārika-fruit (Thag.143-4; ThagA.i.264f).<br>He is probably identical with Kāsumāraphaladāyaka of the Apadāna ii.445.

'jotipāla':['1. Jotipāla.-The Bodhisatta born as the son of the chaplain of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. He was a great archer and became an ascetic.

J.v.140, 141, 142.<br>2. Jotipāla.-The Bodhisatta born as a brahmin of Vehalinga in the time of Kassapa Buddha.Ghatīkāra was his friend and invited Jotipāla to accompany him to the Buddha, but Jotipāla refused to go, saying that a ”shaveling recluse” could be of no use to him. But Ghatīkāra was very insistent, and one day, after they had bathed together in the river, seized Jotipāla by the hair and made a final appeal. This boldness on the part of an inferior (Ghatīkāra was a potter) caused Jotipāla to realise his extreme earnestness and he agreed to go. After hearing the Buddha preach, Jotipāla became a monk (M.ii.46ff; J.i.43; Bu.xxv.10; see also S.i.34f; Mil.221; Mtu.i.319ff).<br>This insulting remark made by Jotipāla regarding Kassapa Buddha led to Gotama, in his last life, having to practise austerities for a longer period than did the other Buddhas (Ap.i.301; UdA.265; ApA.i.95). The memory of what he did as Jotipāla was one of the things that made the Buddha smile. DhsA.294, 496.<br>3. Jotipāla.-A brahmin, son of Govinda, chaplain ofDisampati. Jotipāla was a friend of Disampati’s son, Renu, who had six other nobles as companions. On the death of Govinda, Jotipāla became chaplain to Disampati. He inspired Renu’s six companions to wait on Renu and make him promise to share the kingdom with them when he should come to the throne. This promise Renu kept when he succeeded his father and appointed Jotipāla to carry out the division of the kingdom, which the latter duly did. All the kings wished Jotipāla to be their chaplain, and he instructed them in the art of government, teaching the mantras also to seven eminent Brahmins and to seven hundred young graduates. Jotipāla himself came to be known as Mahā Govinda.<br>After some time, Jotipāla took leave of the seven kings, his disciples and his wives, and spent the four months of the rainy season in a retired spot outside the city, developing jhāna in order to see Brahmā face to face. At the end of the four months, Brahmā Sanankumāra appeared before him and gave him a boon. Jotipāla asked to be taught the way to reach the Brahma-world, and, having listened to Sanankumāra’s exposition, decided to leave the world. The kings and all the others did their best to make him desist from this course, but finding their efforts of no avail they went with him into the homeless life, where all of them profited thereby.<br>Jotipāla was the Bodhisatta (D.ii.232-51; Mtu.i.197ff). He is twice mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.372; iv.135; AA.ii.679) in a list of ancient teachers with very large followings.<br>4. Jotipāla.-A monk at whose request Buddhaghosa wrote the Sāratthappakāsinī and the Manoratthapūranī. He seems to have been a colleague of Buddhaghosa and lived with him in several places, including Kañcīpura. Gv.68; SA.iii.235; AA.ii.874.<br>5. Jotipāla.-A thera of Ceylon. He defeated in debate the adherents of the Vetulla school, and one of their angry followers, Dāthāpabhuti, raised his hand to strike the Thera. An ulcer immediately appeared on Dāthāpabhuti’s hand. Aggabodhi I. gave the Elder a dwelling in the vihāra (Abhayagiri?) - where the discussion took place - and charged his nephew with his care. The king also built for the Elder the Nīlagehapariccheda.

The wife, having given birth to a son, went about saying that if the mother-in-law had been with her such a blessing would have been impossible. When the old woman heard of this, she felt that such things could only be said because Right (Dhamma) was dead and, going into the cemetery, she started to perform a sacrifice in memory of the dead Right.

'kaccāyana':['A treatise on Pāli grammar by Kaccāyana. The treatise is in eight divisions, each division comprising suttas or rules, expressed with great brevity; vutti or supplements, to render the suttas intelligible; payoga or grammatical analyses, with examples, and nyāsa or scholia, explanatory notes of the principal grammatical forms in the shape of questions and answers. The nyāsa often exists as a separate book, called the Mukhamattadīpanī. Orthodox tradition ascribes the whole work to Mahā Kaccāna, but another tradition, recorded in the Kaccāyanabheda, states that the aphorisms are by Kaccāyana, the vutti by Sanghānandī, the illustrations by Brahmadatta and the nyāsa by Vimalabuddhi - all perhaps belonging to the same school of Avanti (see above, Kaccāna).<br>Kaccāyana’s work shows clearly the influence of Sanskrit grammar, chiefly the Kātantra.

The she-elephant of the Jātaka was the landowner’s wife (J.ii.341-5).<br>This Jātaka is illustrated in the Barhut Stupa (Cunningham; Bharhut plate xxv.2).<br>The Kakkata Jātaka is mentioned (DhA.i.119) among those preached by the Buddha giving instances where Ananda offered his life for that of the Bodhisatta. The reference is evidently to theSuvannakakkaṭa Jātaka.<br>The story is also found in the Samyutta Commentary (SA.ii.167), but there the Bodhisatta’s life is saved not by his mate but by his mother.'],
'kakkaṭarasadāyaka':['The story of a farmer in Magadhakhetta, who gave a meal consisting of broth made of crab to a monk suffering from earache, and cured him.

'kakkāru jātaka':['Once a great festival was held in Benares, attended by both humans and non-humans. Among the latter were four gods from Tāvatimsa, wearing wreaths of kakkāru-flowers, the fragrance of which filled the town. When men wondered at the fragrance, the gods showed themselves and their wreaths. Men asked for these flowers, but the gods explained that they could only be worn by those possessed of certain virtues. The king’s chaplain, hoping to deceive the gods, claimed possession of these virtues. The wreath was put on his head and the gods disappeared. The chaplain was seized with great pain in his head, but on trying to remove the wreath he found it impossible to do so. When he had suffered for seven days, the king, hoping to save his life, held another similar festival at which the gods were again present. The chaplain confessed his guilt and obtained relief.<br>The story was told in reference to the vomiting of blood byDevadatta when his disciples left him. v.l. Kakkdru, Takkaru. J.iii.86-90.'],

'kakudha':['1. Kakudha (v.l. Kakkata).-A lay disciple of theBuddha who dwelt at Nādikā. When the Buddha arrived at Nādikā on his last journey, Ananda asked him what had happened to Kakudha, who was already dead. The Buddha replied that Kakudha had found birth in the highest heavens, there to pass away entirely (D.ii.92).<br>2. Kakudha.-A deva. He visited the Buddha at theAñjanavana in Sāketa, and asked him whether he experienced feelings of pleasure and sorrow. The Buddha replied that he had overcome such feelings and was utterly free, whereupon Kakudha uttered his praises (S.i.54f).<br>The Commentary (SA.i.89) says that this Kakudha was a Brahma and that he was an attendant of Moggallāna, thus identifying him with Kakudha (3 below). He lived with the Thera in his youth, died in a Jhāna-trance and was reborn in the Brahma-world.<br>3. Kakudha.-Probably identical with Kakudha (2). He was an inhabitant of Koliya and was an attendant of Moggallāna. Having died, he was reborn among the mind-born (Manomaya) devas and his form was so great that it was as extensive as ”two of three common rice-fields in aMagadha village, and yet so constituted that he was in the way neither of himself nor of others.”<br>Becoming aware of Devadatta’s plans for obtaining possession of the leadership of the Sangha, Kakudha reported the news to Moggallāna, who passed it on to the Buddha. The Buddha asked Moggallāna to keep the matter secret. Moggallāna informed the Buddha that he knew from experience that Kakudha’s predictions proved true (Vin.ii.185f).<br>4. Kakudha.-A Pacceka Buddha of thirty-one kappas ago, to whom Uddāladāyaka Thera, in a previous birth, gave a flower. Ap.i.225.<br>5.

Kakudha Kaccāna.-See Pakudha Kaccāna.<br>7. Kakudha.-A little pond in Mahāmeghavana between the site of the Mahā-Thūpa and the Thūpārāma. The Mahā-Thūpa was at the upper end of the pond, and the spot had been consecrated by the visit of the four Buddhas of the present kappa (Mhv.xv.53ff). Lañjatissa appears to have filled up the pond at great expense, the land around having become waterlogged (Mhv.xxxiii.23f; MT.611).

Among his converts was a fierce yakkha named Naradeva.<br>He held only one assembly of his monks.<br>Kakusandha’s body was forty cubits in height, and he died at the age of forty thousand years in the Khema pleasaunce.<br>The thūpa erected over his relics was one league high.<br>The Bodhisatta was at that time a king named Khema. The Buddha’s chief disciples were Vidhura and Sañjīva among monks, and Sama and Campā among nuns. His personal attendant was Buddhija. Accuta and Samana, Nandā and Sunandā were his most eminent lay-supporters (D.ii.7; Bu.xxiii; J.i.42; BuA.209ff). Kakusandha kept the fast-day (uposatha) every year (DhA.iii.236). In Kakusandha’s time a Māra, named Dūsī (a previous birth of Moggallāna), gave a great deal of trouble to the Buddha and his followers, trying greatly the Buddha’s patience (M.i.333ff; Thag.1187). The Samyutta Nikāya (S.ii.190f) mentions that during the time of Kakusandha, the Mount Vepulla of Rājagaha was named Pācīna-vamsa and the inhabitants were called Tivarā.<br>The monastery built by Accuta on the site where, in the present age, Anāthapindika erected the Jetavanārāma, was half a league in extent, and the ground was bought by golden kacchapas sufficient in number to cover it (J.i.94).<br>According to the Ceylonese chronicles (Dpv.ii.66; xv.25, 34; xvii.9, 16, etc.; Mhv.xv.57-90), Kakusandha paid a visit to Ceylon. The island was then known as Ojadīpa and its capital was Abhayanagara, where reigned King Abhaya. The Mahāmeghavana was called Mahātittha. The Buddha came, with forty thousand disciples, to rid the island of a pestilence caused by yakkhas and stood on the Devakūta mountain from where, by virtue of his own desire, all inhabitants of the country could see him. The Buddha and his disciples were invited to a meal by the king, and after the meal the Mahātittha garden was presented to the Order; there the Buddha sat, in meditation, in order to consecrate various spots connected with the religion. At the Buddha’s wish, the nun Rucānandā brought to the island a branch of the sacred bodhi-tree. The Buddha gave to the people his own drinking-vessel as an object of worship, and returned to Jambudīpa, leaving behind his disciples Mahādeva and Rucānandā to look after the spiritual welfare of the new converts to the faith.<br>In Buddhist Sanskrit texts the name of the Buddha is given as Krakucchanda (See especially Divy.254, 418f; Mtu.iii.247, 330).<br>2.

'kammāsa':['See Kammāsapada.'],
'kammāsadamma':['A township of the Kurūs. TheBuddha, during the course of his wanderings, stayed there several times; the exact place of his residence is, however, mentioned only once, namely the fire-hut of a brahmin of theBhāradvāja-gotta, where a grass mat was spread for him by the brahmin. It was on this occasion, according to theMāgandiya Sutta (M.i.501), that, after a long discussion, Māgandiya was converted.<br>Several important discourses were preached at Kammāsadamma, among them being:<br>the Mahānidāna Sutta (D.ii.55; S.ii.92) the Mahāsatipatthāna Sutta (D.ii.290; M.i.55) the ānañjasappāya Sutta (M.ii.26)The Samyutta Nikāya (S.ii.107f) contains a discourse on handling experiences by way of casual relations, and the Anguttara (A.v.29f ) a discourse on the ten noble states (ariyavāsā), both preached at Kammāsadhamma.<br>Buddhaghosa (SA.ii.89) says that the people there were full of wisdom and their food was nutritious; it was therefore a compliment to their intellectual calibre that the Buddha should have preached these suttas to them.<br>Even in Buddhaghosa’s day the name of the township had two different spellings, and two etymologies are suggested for the names (DA.ii.483). The place was called Kammāsadamma because it was here that the man-eating ogre,Kammāsapāda was tamed and civilized by the Bodhisatta. (Kammāso ettha damito ti, Kammāsadamam-Kammāso ti Kammāsapādo porisādo vuccati.)<br>The spelling Kammāsadhamma is explained on the ground that the people of theKuru country had a code of honour called the Kuruvattadhamma; it was here that Kammāsa (already referred to) was converted and made to accept this code, hence the name of the township. (Kururatthavāsīnam kira kuruvattadhammo, tasmim Kanamāso jāto, tasmā tam thānam ”Kammāso ettha dhamme jāto” ti Kammāsadhammam ti vuccati.)<br>According to the Jātakas, there are two places of the same name, called Cūlakammāsadamma and Mahākammāsadamma respectively, to distinguish one from the other. Mahākammāsadamma, which was evidently the original place, was founded on the spot where the porisāda of the Mahāsutasoma Jātaka was tamed (J.v.411), while Cūlakammāsadamma was the name given to the place where Jayaddisa showed his prowess by his spiritual victory over the ogre in theJayaddisa Jātaka (J.v.35f).<br>In the Divyāvadāna (pp.515f), the place is called Kammāsadamya.

He is identified with Angulimāla (J.v.pp.503f, 511).<br>Buddhaghosa (DA.ii.483) explains the name (”Spot=foot”) as being given because of a wound he once received, which healed, leaving a scar like a piece of well-grained timber (cittadārusadiso). This refers to the flight of the porisāda from his pursuers, when he trod on an acacia stake (khānu) which pierced his foot (J.v.472).<br>According to Buddhaghosa, the cannibal in the Jayaddisa Jātaka was also called Kammāsa or Kammāsapāda.

In the Ekarāja Jātaka, which purports to relate the same story, and again in the Mahāsīlava Jātaka, the king is referred to by other names.

Sāmā, sending word to the governor that the robber was her brother, persuaded him, by means of a bribe of one thousand pieces of money, to set him free and send him to her for a little while. Then, using all her guile, she substituted for the robber a youth who was enamoured of her and who had happened to visit her that day. This youth was killed in the place of the robber, who was brought to Sāmā, and she showered on him all her favours. Fearing that when Sāmā grew tired of him she might betray him, the robber went with her one day into the park and, on the pretence of embracing her, squeezed her till she swooned, then taking all her ornaments, made good his escape. Sāmā, all unsuspecting, imagined him to have run away from fear of having killed her by his too violent embraces, and she used all her ingenuity in searching for him, such as bribing some wandering minstrels to sing, wherever they went, a set of stanzas declaring that she was still alive and loved none but him, her lover. One day the robber heard the stanzas and learned from the minstrels that Sāmā still longed for him, but he refused to return, sending her word that he doubted her constancy. In despair, Sāmā returned to her former means of livelihood.

The Buddha agreed and enumerated the four kinds of people in the world: those who torment themselves, torment others, torment both themselves and others, and, lastly, those who torment neither, dwelling beyond appetites, in bliss and holiness. Pessa stated that he respected only the fourth class, and having given his reasons went away.

One day, Kinnarā, on looking out, saw a loathsome cripple in the shade of a jambu-tree near her window, and conceived a passion for the man. Thereafter she would wait for the king to fall asleep and would then, nightly, visit the cripple, taking him dainty foods and having her pleasure with him. One day the king, returning from a procession, saw the misshapen creature, and asked the chaplain if such a man could ever win the love of a woman. The cripple, hearing the question, proudly boasted of his intimacy with the queen. At the chaplain’s suggestion the king watched the queen’s movements that same night, and saw the cripple abuse her and strike her for being late in coming. The blow fell on her ear breaking off her ear ornament, which the king picked up.<br>The next day he ordered the queen to appear before him in all her ornaments, and having proved that he knew of her infidelity, handed her over to the chaplain to be executed. Pañcālacanda, pitying the woman, begged that she should be pardoned, because in being unchaste she had but obeyed the instincts common to all women. To prove his contention, Pañcālacanda took the king with him and, in disguise, they wandered through Jambudīpa, testing the virtue of various women, including that of a young bride who was being taken to her husband’s house. Convinced that all women were alike, the king spared Kinnarā’s life, but drove her out of the palace together with the cripple, and caused the jambu-tree to be cut down.<br>The story was among those related by the bird Kunāla to his friend Punnamukha, testifying to the unfaithfulness of women.

There some robbers left some stolen goods outside his hut, and Mandavya, being charged before the king, was impaled, but by virtue of his great powers he continued to live. Dīpāyana came to see his friend, and finding him thus and learning that he bore no ill-will towards anyone, took up his abode under his impaled body. Gouts of gore fell from Mandavya’s wound on to Dīpāyana’s golden body and there dried, forming black spots; so he came to be called Kanha-Dīpāyana.

Hence, probably, his name. Mhv.xxxv.9ff; MT.640; Dpv.xx.38.'],
'kaniska':['Kaniska The great Kusāna king of India, a renowned patron of Buddhism. His name is spelt as Kāniska in inscriptions. On coins it appears, in Greek script, as Kanérki, or in the genitive Kanerkou which some scholars read as Kanéshki and Kanéshkou. Kasmir tradition gives the variant Kanistha which become Kanit’a in Chinese. Alberuni refers to him as Kanik\[1\].<br>There are different theories regarding the nationality of Kaniska. It is widely accepted that he is of Yuch-chi origin. It is said that during the 2nd century B.C. the Yuch-chi, a Mongoloid nomadic tribe of Central Asia, was forced out of their pasture lands by their more powerful neighbours, the Hiung-nu. Being thus driven out they migrated westwards and in the course of their migration conquered the Wu sun tribe and settled down in the basin of the lli river. Here they were divided into two branches of which the minor branch (Siao-yueh-chi) deflected southwards and settled down along the Tibetan border while the major branch (Ta-yueh-chi) proceeded forwards, defeated the Sakas and settled down in the conquered territory. From there they were again expelled by the son of the dead Wu sun chieftain. Resuming their march, they finally occupied Bactria and Sogdiana and by about the 1st century B.C. gave up their nomadic habits and adopted a more settled life, Here they were divided into five groups of whom the Kusānas (Kueishuang) overpowered the rest and united the whole tribe under Kadphises I (i.e., Kujula Kadphises) who captured some regions of North West India. He was succeeded by his son Kadphises II (i.e., Wima Kadphises) who annexed further Indian territory. Kaniska, whos connection with Kadphises II is not known\[2\], is said to have succeeded him\[3\].<br>Sten Konow and Fleet consider that Kaniska belonged to a separate clan of the Kusānas which originated from Khotan\[4\]. B.N. Puri\[5\] says that the Kusāna and the Yueh-chi are two different racial groups and that the former is of Iranian Saka stock while the latter is of Mongoloid origin.<br>There is no consensus among scholars regarding the date of Kaniska. The earliest and the latest dates assigned to his accession are 5 B.C. and 278 A.C. S Levi suggested 5 B.C.\[6\] Fleet who places it in 58 B.C. also considers him to be the founder of the Vikrama Samvat\[7\]. According to Professor Van Lohuizen de Leeuw Kaniska acceded to the throne between 71-86 A.C.\[8\] Cunningham places him in 80 A.C.\[9\] Fergusson, Oldenberg, Rapson, Thomas, Banerji, Jayaswal, and later, even Marshal and Levi place Kaniska in 78 A.C. and some of them regard him also as the founder of the Saka era\[10\]. Vincent Smith, Sten Konow favours one of the two dates 120 or 128-29 A.C.\[11\] Ghirshman suggests the date 144 A.C. which is endorsed by Benjamin Rowland and B.N Puri\[12\]. The date put forward by R.C. Majumdar is 248 A.C.\[13\] D.R. Bhandarkar first suggested 278 A.C. but later adopted 128 A.C.\[14\]<br>Of these numerous dates the most widely accepted is 78 A.C. though some modern scholars like Benjamin Rowland and B.N. Puri prefer the date 144 on the ground that the latest archaeological discoveries made at Begram in Afghanistan by Ghrishman add more weight to it.<br>The view put forward by Fleet, and supported by R. Otto Franke and J. Kennedy, that Kaniska preceded the two Kadphises, is no longer held as valid\[15\]. The excavation done at Taxila has shown that the coins of the Kaniska group of the Kusāna kings were found in the upper (i.e. later) strata of earth while those of the Kadphises group were in the lower (i.e., earlier) strata. The connection between Kadphises II and Kaniska is not known. However, the evidence provided by the coin finds in which the coins of Kadphises II and Kaniska were found together proves that they were close to each other in time. It is plausible to hold that Kaniska succeeded Kadphises II after a short interregnum\[16\].<br>It is quite certain that Kaniska succeeded to a fairly large kingdom of Kadphises II. He expanded this kingdom by annexing more territory both in India and in Central Asia. Inscriptions of Kaniska found at Kosam (Allahabad)\[17\], Sarnath\[18\], Mathura\[19\], Sui-vihar (Bhavalpur)\[20\], Zeda (Und)\[21\], Manikiala (Rawalpindj)\[22\] and his coins, found in Bihar and Pātaliputta, suggest that he ruled over a vast Indian territory\[23\]. Chinese and Tibetan tradition record that he conquered Sāketa and Magadha and carried off the eminent Buddhist scholar Asvaghosa\[24\]. He also conquered Kashmir, Punjab and Sind. In Kashmir he erected numerous monuments and founded a city called Kaniskapura, now represented by the village Kanispor. Outside India his rule extended to Afghanistan, Bactria, Kashgar, Khotan and Yarkand.<br>Though he seems to have cherished a marked preference for Kashmir he had his capital at Purusapura, the modern Peshawar which lay in the main route from Afghanistan to the Indus plain.<br>Kaniska was a renowned warrior. His most daring military feat is his conquest of Kashgar, Yarkand and Khotan, which were dependencies of China, Kadphises II is also said to have tried to accomplish this feat without success and consequently had to pay tribute to China. Kaniska not only freed his kingdom from this obligation, but also took away hostages from a dependency of China\[25\]. Some scholars are of opinion that on a previous occasion Kaniska, too, tasted defeat at the hands of the Chinese general Pan-chao.\[26\]<br>Kaniska treated his hostages with utmost consideration, providing them with places of residence suitable for each season. These hostages are said to have resided in the Sha lo ka monastery probably situated in the hills of Kapisa (modern Kafiristan) and in monasteries at Gandhāra and Eastern Punjab (Cinabhukti).\[27\]<br>Buddhist tradition describes Kaniska as a great patron of Buddhism comparable to Asoka: Legends about his conversion closely resemble those of Asoka, and it is probable that these legends were based on stories detailing Asoka’s conversion. Tradition represents Kaniska, before his conversion to Buddhism, as one who had no faith either in right or wrong and as a person who did not pay any attention to Buddhism. It is also said that the immediate cause of his conversion was the deep remorse he felt over the bloodshed in his numerous wars.\[28\] Though this tradition is based on facts it could be surmised that it was built up by the Buddhists making Kaniska to emulate Asoka and show the ennobling influence of Buddhism on him.<br>Epigraphical and numismatic records do not provide clear testimony regarding his conversion and religion. Vincent Smith surmises\[29\] that his coins show that his conversion to Buddhism did not take place until he had been on the throne for some time. The finest and presumably the earliest coins bear legends, Greek in both script and language, with images of the sun and moon under the names Helios and Selene (spelt Saléné on the coins). On later issues, the Greek script is retained but the language is Knotanese, while the reverse of the coins represents gods worshipped by Greeks, Persians and Indians.\[30\] The coins that bear the images of Sākyamuni are considered to be the latest. Some Indian scholars think that if numismatic evidence proves anything, it is only his eclecticism, or that his coins only depict the various forms of faith prevailing in his vast empire.\[31\] Despite attempts to adduce evidence to prove that he was not a Buddhist, the testimony provided by the numerous monuments he has built, as well as his association with the Buddhist Council held during his reign show that, even if he was not a Buddhist, he was more bent towards Buddhism than towards any other religion. An inscription found on a relic casket, too, is taken by some scholars as evidence to establish that he favoured the Sarvāstivāda school of Buddhism.\[32\]<br>Tradition records that Kaniska studied Buddhism in his leisure hours under the guidance of Pārsva. Tradition also states that he carried off Asvaghosa from Pātaliputra.\[33\] Even if this story is not accepted it is plausible to hold that Kaniska and Asvaghosa were contemporaries and that these two were associates.<br>Two eminent Buddhist scholars Vasumitra and Nāgārjuna too, are said to be his contemporaries.\[34\] Buddhism at that time was a force to reckon with, and despite the possibility that Kaniska was doing his best to consolidate big vast empire; he adopted Buddhism to keep abreast of the trends prevalent at the time.<br>According to the Buddhist tradition the greatest service rendered to Buddhism by Kaniska is his convening of the Buddhist Council during his reign. There are different accounts of this council. The best known is that of Hsuan-tsang.\[35\] Paramārtha in his Life of Vasubandhu gives another version which, though generally considered to be the same as that of Hsuan-tsang, contains different information.\[36\] Tārānātha also records an account, which, though confused, contains important information. It is not relevant at present, to extract facts from these legendary accounts which are confused and often discrepant.<br>It is said that Kaniska, greatly puzzled by the conflicting teachings found in different schools, suggested to Pārsva to summon a council of eminent monks to obtain an authoritative disposition of the doctrine. There was some difference of opinion among them as to the venue of the council and they finally decided to hold it at the Kundalavana vihāra in Kashmir.\[37\] Vasumitra was elected president with Asvaghosa as the Vice president. The members, five hundred in all composed 100,000 stanzas of Upadesa Sāstra explanatory of the canonical sutras, 100,000 stanzas of Vinaya vibhāsā sastra explanatory of the vinaya and 100,000 of Abhidharma vibhāsā sastra explanatory of the Abhidharma. Kaniska is said to have caused these treatises to be written on copper plates and enclosed them in stone boxes which he deposited in a stūpa specially constructed for that purpose.<br>It is not possible to form a clear idea about the work accomplished at the Council. Some scholars think that the chief business of the Council was to collect canonical texts, and to prepare commentaries of different schools of Buddhism.\[38\]<br>Tradition seems to connect the rise of Māhānānana with Kaniska and with the Buddhist Council held during his reign.\[39\] The fact that this Council is recognised by the Mahānānists\[40\] is also taken as evidence on this point. But a close scrutiny of the available information regarding the Council as well as the Buddhist activities carried out by Kaniska shows that this tradition cannot be relied upon. It is a fact that Tārānātha observes that all kinds of Mahāyānist writing appeared at this time and that the Theravādins raised no objection. But he neither clearly states nor implies that Kaniska personally took any interest in promoting Mahāyāna teachings, or that any Mahāyāna treatises were composed at that Council. On the other hand, it is generally regarded that this Council was exclusively a council of the Sarvāstivādins of northern India and that the Mahāyānists did not take part in it.\[41\] It is apparent that after holding this Council the Sarvāstivādin school of Buddhism gained more importance than before.<br>Whatever the tradition is there is no reasonable ground to hold that Kaniska was responsible for the rise and rapid spread of Mahāyānism and that the Council held during his reign was a Mahāyāna Buddhist\[42\] Council. It is plausible to hold that he was more bent towards Sarvāstivāda teachings and this is established by the inscription on the relic casket.<br>Of the numerous stūpas he is said to have built, the most famous is the one at Shah-ji-ki-Dheri near Peshawar. From the accounts of the Chinese travellers of the fifth and seventh centuries it appears that it was one of the wonders at the time. This stūpa is said to have been 130 metres in height, resting upon a stone substructure 50 metres high, topped by an iron mast 10 metres high with gilded metal discs. It is assumed that the original form of the stūpa as it appeared in the days of Kaniska, looked quite different from the form that could be reconstructed from the ruins. It is also believed that it was rebuilt many times.\[43\]<br>The reliquary enshrined in the Kaniska cetiya is also worthy of note. The object is a round pyxis, made of an amalgum of precious metals. The lower hand of the drum consists of representation in relief of garland bearing erotes and Kusāna sovereign, identified by scholars as Kaniska, between the divinities of the sun and moon; on the side of the lid is a flock of geese (hamsa). To the top of the cover are fastened free standing statuettes of the Buddha, flanked by Indra and Brahmā. The most interesting feature of the object is the Greek name of the maker, agesilas, the overseer of works at the Kaniska-caitya. The inscription found on the reliquary also states that it was made ”for acceptance of the teachers of the Sarvāstivādin school” and this is cited as evidence to prove that Kaniska was an adherent of this school of Buddhism.\[44\]<br>During Kaniska’s reign his empire was enriched through trade carried on with countries outside India, especially with Rome and Asia Minor, and as such he had the necessary resources to patronise the arts. Many scholars believe that Gandhāra art attained its peak during his reign.\[45\] Tradition which credits Kaniska with having built many stūpas, also seems to support this contention. According to Benjamin Rowland ”The Art of Gandhāra is, properly speaking; the official art of the Kushān emperor Kaniska and his successors\[46\] (see also, GANDHāRA).<br>Like Asoka, Kaniska also helped missionary activities. It was during his reign that Buddhism spread and became firmly established in central and eastern Asia. There are no records of any missionaries sent by him. But it is accepted that under his patronage Buddhism greatly flourished and spread throughout his vast empire. One writer has observed that ”there was ceaseless missionary activity throughout his vast empire which extended from Madhyadesa in India to Central Asia. A truly integrated Asian culture came into existence at this time..,”\[47\] Vincent Smith\[48\] observes that the legend regarding his death possibly may be founded on fact.<br>A statue of Kaniska was discovered by Tokritila, in the village of Māt. In this headless statue the king is represented with his right hand resting on a mace and the left clamping the hilt of the sword. He is dressed in a tunic reaching down to the knees, and held round the loins by a girdle. He wears heavy boots with straps round the ankles. Though headless, an inscription found on it proves conclusively that it represents Kaniska.\[49\]<br>BIBLIOGRAPHY<br>Bapat, P.V. (ed.) 2500 years of Buddhism, India 1956; Beal, S.

'kaniṭṭha':['King of Ceylon (227-245 A.D.). He was the younger brother of Bhātika-Tissa. He built the Ratanapāsāda at Abhayagiri for Mahānāga of Bhūtārama, and he also built at Abhayagiri a wall, a great parivena, and the Manisoma-vihāra. He built a cetiya at Ambatthala, restored the temple at Nāgadipa, and made the Kukkutagiri cells. Among his other works were fourteen pāsādas at the Mahāvihāra, a road to the Dakkhina-vihāra, the Bhūtārāma-vihāra, the Rāmagoṇaka, the Nandatissa monastery, the Anulatissapabbata-vihāra, the Niyelatissārāma, the Pīlapitthi-vihāra, and the Rājamahā-vihāra.<br>He had two sons, Khujjanāga and Kuñcanāga (q.v.). Mhv.xxxvi.6ff'],
'kaṅkhā':['He belonged to a very wealthy family in Sāvatthi. One day, after his midday meal, he went with others to hear the Buddha preach and, accepting the word of the Buddha, he entered the Order. According to the Apadāna (ii.491), he heard the Buddha preach at Kapilavatthu.<br>He attained arahantship by way of practising jhāna, and so proficient in jhāna did he become that the Buddha declared him chief of the monks who practised it (A.i.24; Ud.v.9; AA.i.129f; Thag.3; ThagA.33f). Before he became an arahant he was greatly troubled in mind as to what was permissible for him to use and what was not (akappiyā muggā, na kappanti muggā paribhuñjitum, etc.). This characteristic of his became well known, hence his name (UdA.314).<br>In the time of Padumuttara he was a brahmin of Hamsavatī, well versed in the Vedas. One day, while listening to the Buddha’s preaching, he heard him declare a monk in the assembly as chief among those who practised jhāna, and himself wished for the same honour under a future Buddha (Ap.ii.419f). He is often mentioned in company with other very eminent disciples - e.g., Anuruddha, Nandiya, Kimbila, Kundadhāna and Ananda - at the preaching of the Nalakapāna Sutta (M.i.462). The Mahāgosinga Sutta (M.i.212ff) records a discussion between Moggallāna, Mahā Kassapa, Anuruddha, Revata and Ananda, and there we find Revata praising, as the highest type of monk, one who delights in meditation and has his habitation in the abodes of solitude.<br>Kankhā-Revata appears to have survived the Buddha.<br>In the Uttaramātu-peta Vatthu (PvA.141ff), Uttara’s mother having been born as a peta, and having wandered about for fifty-five years without water, came upon Revata enjoying the siesta on the banks of the Ganges and begged him for succor. Having learnt her story, Revata gave various gifts to the Sangha in her name, and so brought her happiness.'],
'kaṅkhāvitaranī':['A commentary, also called Mātikaṭṭhakathā, by Buddhaghosa on the Pātimokkha of the Vinaya Pitaka. The colophon also contains a summary, a kind of uddāna, of the contents. It is stated that the work was written at the request of a thera named Sona, and Buddhaghosa declares most emphatically that there is not even a single word in the book which is not in conformity with the Canon or the Commentaries of the Mahāvihāra (p.204, ed. Hewavitarane Bequest Series; Gv.59, 69.). The Gandhavamsa (61f, 71; also Svd.1212) mentions a tīkā on the Kankhāvitaranī named Vinayatthamañjūsā, written by Buddhanāga at the request of Sumedha.'],
'kankheyya sutta':['The Sākyan Mahānāma visits Lomasavangīsa at the Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu and asks him if the learner’s way of life is the same as that of a Tathāgata. No, says the Elder; a learner strives to abandon the five hindrances (nīvāraṇa); the arahants have already completely destroyed them. S.v.327f.'],
'kannakatthala':['A deer-park in Ujuññā. There the Buddha sometimes stayed; he was once visited there by Acela Kassapa, to whom he preached the Kassapasīhanāda Sutta (D.i.161), and again by Pasenadi, king of Kosala; to him he preached the Kannakatthala Sutta. M.ii.125.'],
'kannakatthala sutta':['Pasenadi visits the Buddha at the Deer Park in Kannakatthala and conveys to him the greetings of his two queens Somā and Sakulā.<br>He then enquired of the Buddha if it were true that, according to him, no recluse or brahmin could claim absolute knowledge and insight. The Buddha explains that his teaching is that no one can know and see everything at one and the same time.<br>The king proceeds to ask whether there is any distinction of caste in the matter of deliverance and whether there are any gods.<br>Vidūdabha and Ananda join in the discussion, and thenSañjaya ākāsagotta, charged with having spread a wrong interpretation of the Buddha’s teaching, is announced and lays the blame on Vidūdabha. The arrival of the king’s chariot puts an end to the dispute (M.ii.125ff).'],
'kaṇṇakujja':['A district in Jambudīpa; it is mentioned in a list of places passed by the Buddha on his way from Verañjā toBārānasī, across the Ganges, the route passing through Verañjā, Soreyya,Sankassa, Kannakujja,Payāgatittha, here crossing the river to Benares (Vin.iii.11).<br>It may have been the very road followed by Revata when going from Sankassa to Sahajāti, this road passing through Kannakujja, Udumbara, and Aggalapura (Vin.ii.299).<br>In the Dīpavamsa (iii.26; MT. (82) calls it Kannagotta) the city is called Kannagoccha, and is said to have been the capital of nine kings of the Mahāsammata race, the last king being Naradeva.<br>According to Hiouen Thsang, the distance from Sankassa to Kannakujja was two hundred li, or thirty-three miles, in a north-west direction. Fa Hsien gives the distance as forty-nine miles. (Buddhist Records, p.205; Giles, p.47. For a descriptive account see CAGI.433ff; see also Mtu.ii.442f.; 459f.; 485 and iii.16, 34).<br>According to the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p.193), it was at Kannakujja that Phussa Buddha first preached to his two chief disciples.

He was eighteen cubits long from neck to tail and proportionately broad, quite white in colour, like a clean conch-shell.<br>In this journey of Gotama, Channa held on to Kanthaka’s tail. The horse had the strength, had it been necessary, to clear the ramparts of the city, eighteen hands high, at one bound, with the prince and Channa on his back.

'karavīka':['One of the seven mountains surrounding Sineru (SnA.ii.443; Sp.i.119; Vsm.206; DhsA.298).<br>Between Karavīka and Isādhara lay a Sīdantarasamudda. J.vi.125;<br>see also Mtu.ii.300, where it is called Khadiraka, and Divy.217, 450.'],
'karerikuṭikā':['One of the four principal buildings of Jetavana, the others being Kosambakuti, Gandhakuti, and Salalaghara, each being erected at a cost of one hundred thousand. Karerikutikā was built by Anāthapindika and was raised on pillars. A mandapa of Kareri (varuṇa) trees stood at the entrance to the kutikā, hence its name. DA.ii.407. The Bharhut bas-relief, however, makes of it a one-roomed cottage, Dial.ii.4, n.1. SnA.ii.403 has Candanamālā for Salalaghara.<br>Here was preached the Mahāpadāna Sutta (D.ii.1ff).'],
'karerimandalamālā':['A pavilion near the Karerikutikā, evidently a hall with a thatched roof supported by wooden pillars, but with no walls (D.ii.1; Dial.ii.5, n.2). Buddhaghosa calls it a nisīdanasālā (sitting-hall). Between this hall and the Gandhakuti was the Karerimandapa. Probably the term Karerimandalamālā was used to denote all the grounds within the Gandhakuti, the Karerikutikā and this hall (Gandhakuti pi Karerikutikā pi sālā pi Karerimandalamālo ti vuccati) (DA.ii.407). Dhammapāla, however, says that only the mandapa and the sālā were called Karerimandalamālā. He explains mandalamālā thus: tiṇapannacchadanam anovassakam mandalamālo; atimuttakādi latāmandapo ti apare (UdA.203). The monks seem to have been in the habit of sitting out here and talking on various topics at the close of the day. One such topic is recorded in the Udāna (Ud., p.30f), for discussing which the monks drew on themselves the Buddha’s stern rebuke.'],
'karoti':['A class of spirits, associated with the Nāgas and forming one of the five defences of the Devas against the Asuras. The Jātaka scholiast says that Karoti is a name for the Supannas (a species of Garuda), and that they were so called because of their food and drink which were called Karoti (tesam karoti nāma pānabhojanam). J.i.204; cp. Karotapānayah, given as the name of a class of Yaksas (Mtu.i.30, 394); also Dvy.218.'],
'karoto sutta':['Discussion of the view that there is neither merit nor demerit in any kind of action whatsoever, whether good or bad (S.iii.208). The reference is evidently to the heresy of Pūrana Kassapa (C.p. D.i.52).'],
'kasālla':['A tank in South Ceylon repaired by Parakkamabāhu I. (Cv.lxviii.48) A fortress of this name is also mentioned, where Gokanna was defeated (Cv.lxx.72).'],
'kasī':['A brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, living at Ekanālā, inDakkhināgiri. The Buddha visited him in the eleventh year after the Enlightenment (Thomas, op. cit., p.117). The brahmin was so called on account of his profession of agriculture. On the day of his festive sowing (maṅgalavappa), the Buddha visited him alone (having seen his upanissaya for arahantship), and stood near the place where food was being distributed to a very large number of people engaged in the festival. The brahmin, seeing the Buddha begging for alms, suggests that the Buddha should work for his living - plough and sow just as he does. (The Sūtrālaṅkāra says the brahmin threw water on the Buddha in order to drive him away; Sylvain Levy, JA.1908, xii.99).<br>The Buddha answers that he, too, is a farmer, and explains his meaning to the bewildered brahmin, who, greatly pleased, offers him a large bowl filled with milk-rice. The Buddha refuses the gift on the plea that Buddhas never accept wages for their sermons. At the Buddha’s own suggestion the food is cast into the river because no one is capable of digesting food once offered to a Tathāgata. (The food had become too rich because the gods had added ojā to it; see also Mil.231). When the rice touches the water it crackles and smokes and the brahmin, greatly marvelling, falls at the Buddha’s feet and professes himself henceforth the Buddha’s follower. Soon after, he enters the Order, and in due course becomes an arahant. Sn.12ff; SnA.131ff; the Samyutta does not mention his arahantship (S.i.171ff), though the Commentary does so (SA.i.188ff).'],
'kasī bhāradvāja sutta':['The Buddhist Parable of the Sower, forming the fourth sutta of the Uraga Vagga of the Sutta Nipāta. (Pp.12ff; also found in the Samyutta i.171ff under the name of Kasī-Sutta and included in the Paritta). It contains the story of the Buddha’s visit to Kasī-Bhāradvāja given above. The Buddha tells him that in his work as a Teacher are to be found all the elements of a farmer’s duties: faith is the seed, insight the plough, mindfulness the ploughshare and goad, energy the burden-bearing team. The harvest produced by the sowing is nibbāna and the food ambrosia, free from suffering and sorrow.'],
'kasmīra':['A district in Northern India, the modern Kashmir. In the Pali texts it is always mentioned with Gandhāra and probably once formed part of that kingdom. (See also PHAI., p.93. The Jātakas mention the countries separately as comprising two kingdoms ruled by a single king, e.g., J.iii.364, 378). At the end of the Third Council, Moggaliputta sent the thera Majjhantika to propagate the religion in Kasmīra-Gandhāra. Majjhantika quelled the power of the Nāga-king Aravāla (q.v.), who was a menace to the inhabitants, and converted him to the faith, while the yakkha Pandaka and his wife Hāritā, with their five hundred sons, became sotāpannas. The thera preached the āsīvisūpama Sutta to the assembled multitude and won eighty thousand converts, while one hundred thousand persons entered the Order. We are told that from that time onwards the yellow robe was held in great esteem in Kasmīra. (Mhv.xii.3,9 ff; Dpv.viii.4; Sp.i.64ff; see also Beal, op. cit., i.134, n.39). There was evidently a large community of monks at Kasmīra, till long after the coming of Majjhantika, for we are told that two hundred and eighty thousand monks, led by Uttinna, came from Kasmīra to Anurādhapura on the occasion of the foundation ceremony of the Mahā Thupa (Mhv.xxix.37).<br>In Hiouien Thsang’s time Kasmīra seems to have been an independent kingdom whose king was given to serpent-worship while his queen was a follower of the Buddha. Near the capital was a stūpa which enshrined a tooth of the Buddha. This tooth was soon after taken away by Harsavardhana of Kanoj. (CAGI.104ff; Beal, i.116f, etc.)<br>Sāgala is mentioned as being twelve leagues from Kasmīra (Mil.82).'],
'kassaka sutta':['Once the Buddha was at Sāvatthi preaching to the monks on nibbāna. Māra appears in the guise of a peasant, dishevelled, wearing hempen garments, with a mighty plough on his shoulder, and asks the Buddha if he has seen his oxen. The Buddha declares, unequivocally, that he has no eyes for things owned; having escaped completely from worldly desires, possessions and ownership, his mind furnishes no gateway for Māra. S.i.114.'],
'kassakagiri':['See Kassapagiri.'],
'kassapa':['1. Kassapa Buddha.-Also called Kassapa Dasabala to distinguish him from other Kassapas.<br>The twenty-fourth Buddha, the third of the present neon (the Bhaddakappa) and one of the seven Buddhas mentioned in the Canon (D.ii.7).<br>He was born in Benares, in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<br>of brahmin parents, Brahmadatta and Dhanavatī, belonging to the Kassapagotta.<br>For two thousand years he lived in the household, in three different palaces, Hamsa, Yasa and Sirinanda. (The BuA.217 calls the first two palaces Hamsavā and Yasavā).<br>He had as chief wife Sunandā, by whom he begot a son, Vijitasena.<br>Kassapa left the world, traveling in his palace (pāsāda), and practiced austerities for only seven days.<br>Just before his Enlightenment his wife gave him a meal of milk-rice, and a yavapāla named Soma gave him grass for his seat.<br>His bodhi was a banyan-tree, and<br>he preached his first sermon at Isipatana to a crore of monks who had renounced the world in his company.<br>He performed the Twin-Miracle at the foot of an asana-tree outside Sundaranagara.<br>He held only one assembly of his disciples; among his most famous conversions was that of a yakkha, Naradeva (q.v.).<br>His chief disciples were Tissa and Bhāradvāja among monks, and Anulā and Uruvelā among nuns, his constant attendant being Sabbamitta.<br>Among his patrons, the most eminent were Sumaṅgala and Ghattīkāra, Vijitasenā and Bhaddā.<br>His body was twenty cubits high, and,<br>after having lived for twenty thousand years, he died in the Setavya pleasance at Setavyā in Kāsī.<br>Over his relics was raised a thūpa one league in height, each brick of which was worth one crore.<br>It is said (MA.i.336ff ) that there was a great difference of opinion as to what should be the size of the thūpa and of what material it should be constructed; when these points were finally settled and the work of building had started, the citizens found they had not enough money to complete it. Then an anāgāmī devotee, named Sorata, went all over Jambudīpa, enlisting the help of the people for the building of the thūpa. He sent the money as he received it, and on hearing that the work was completed, he set out to go and worship the thūpa; but he was seized by robbers and killed in the forest, which later came to be known as the Andhavana.<br>Upavāna, in a previous birth, became the guardian deity of the cetiya, hence his great majesty in his last life (DA.ii.580; for another story of the building of the shrine see DhA.iii.29).<br>Among the thirty-seven goddesses noticed by Guttila, when he visited heaven, was one who had offered a scented five-spray at the cetiya (J.ii.256). So did Alāta offer āneja-flowers and obtain a happy rebirth (J.vi.227).<br>The cause of Mahā-Kaccāna’s golden complexion was his gift of a golden brick to the building of Kassapa’s shrine (AA.i.116).<br>At the same cetiya, Anuruddha, who was then a householder in Benares, offered butter and molasses in bowls of brass, which were placed without any interval around the cetiya (AA.i.105).<br>Among those who attained arahantship under Kassapa is mentioned Gavesī, who, with his five hundred followers, strove always to excel themselves until they attained their goal (A.iii.214ff).<br>Mahākappina, then a clansman, built, for Kassapa’s monks, a parivena with one thousand cells (AA.i.175).<br>Bakkula’s admirable health and great longevity were due to the fact that he had given the first fruits of his harvest to Kassapa’s monks (MA.iii.932).<br>During the time of Kassapa Buddha, the Bodhisatta was a brahmin youth named Jotipāla who, afterwards, coming under the influence of Ghatīkāra, became a monk. (Bu.xxv.; BuA.217ff; D.ii.7; J.i.43, 94; D.iii.196; Mtu.i.303ff, 319). This Ghatīkāra was later born in the Brahma-world and visited Gotama, after his Enlightenment. Gotama then reminded him of this past friendship, which Ghatīkāra seemed too modest to mention (S.i.34f).<br>The Majjhima Nikāya (M.ii.45f ) gives details of the earnestness with which Ghatīkāra worked for Jotipāla’s conversion when Kassapa was living at Vehalinga. The same sutta bears evidence of the great regard Kassapa had for Ghatīkāra.<br>The king of Benares at the time of Kassapa was Kikī, and the four gateways of Kassapa’s cetiya were built, one by Kikī, one by his son Pathavindhara, one by his ministers led by his general, and the last by his subjects with the treasurer at their head (SnA.i.194).<br>It is said that the Buddha’s chief disciple, Tissa, was born on the same day as Kassapa and that they were friends from birth. Tissa left the world earlier and became an ascetic. When he visited the Buddha after his Enlightenment, he was greatly grieved to learn that the Buddha ate meat (āmagandha), and the Buddha preached to him the āmagandha Sutta, by which he was converted (SnA.i.280ff).<br>The Ceylon Chronicles (Mhv.xv.128ff; Sp.i.87; Dpv.xv.55ff; Mbv.129) mention a visit paid by Kassapa to Ceylon in order to stop a war between King Jayanta and his younger brother. The island was then known as Mandadīpa, with Visāla as capital. The Buddha came with twenty thousand disciples and stood on Subhakūta, and the armies seeing him stopped the fight. In gratitude, Jayanta presented to the Buddha the Mahāsāgara garden, in which was afterwards planted a branch of the Bodhi-tree brought over by Sudhammā, in accordance with the Buddha’s wish. The Buddha preached at the Asokamālaka, the Sudassanamālaka and the Somanassamālaka, and gave his rain-cloak as a relic to the new converts, for whose spiritual guidance he left behind his disciples Sabbananda and Sudhammā and their followers. In Kassapa’s time Mt. Vepulla at Rājagaha was known as Supassa and its inhabitants as the Suppiyas (S.ii.192).<br>But many other places had the same names in the time of Kassapa as they had in the present age - e.g., Videha (J.vi.122), Sāvatthi (J.vi.123),Kimbila (J.vi.121) and Bārānasī. (J.vi.120).<br>Besides the āmagandha Sutta mentioned above, various other teachings are mentioned as having been first promulgated by Kassapa and handed on down to the time of Gotama and re-taught by him. Such, for instance, are the questions (pucchā) of āḷavaka and Sabhiya and the stanzas taught to Sutasoma by the brahmin Nanda of Takkasilā (J.v.476f; 453). The Mittavinda Jātaka (No.104) is mentioned as belonging to the days of Kassapa Buddha (J.i.413).<br>Mention is also made of doctrines which had been taught by Kassapa but forgotten later, and Gotama is asked by those who had heard faint echoes of them to revive them (E.g., MA, i.107, 528; AA.i.423). A sermon attributed to Kassapa, when he once visited Benares with twenty thousand monks, is included in the story of Pandita-Sāmanera (DhA.ii.127ff). It was on this occasion that Kassapa accepted alms from the beggar Mahāduggata in preference to those offered by the king and the nobles.<br>Kassapa held the uposatha only once in six months (DhA.iii.236).<br>Between the times of Kassapa and Gotama the surface of the earth grew enough to cover Sūkārakata-lena (MA.ii.677).<br>The records of Chinese pilgrims contain numerous references to places connected with Kassapa. Hiouien Thsang speaks of a stūpa containing the relics of the whole body of the Buddha, to the north of the town, near Srāvasti, where, according to him, Kassapa was born (Beal, op. cit., ii.13). Mention is also made of a footprint of Kassapa (Ibid.i., Introd. ciii). Stories of Kassapa are also found in the Divyāvadāna (E.g., pp.22f; 344f; 346f; see also Mtu., e.g., i.59, 303f).<br>The Dhammapada Commentary (iii.250f ) contains a story, which seems to indicate that, near the village of Todeyya, there was a shrine thought to be that of Kassapa and held in high honour by the inhabitants of the village. After the disappearance of Kassapa’s Sāsana, a class of monks called Setavattha-samanavamsa (”white-robed recluses”) tried to resuscitate it, but without success (VibhA.432).<br>2. Kassapa Thera.-The son of an Udicca-brahmin of Sāvatthi, who died when Kassapa was still young. Having heard the Buddha preach at Jetavana, he entered the First Fruit of the Path and, with his mother’s leave, became a monk. Some time later, wishing to accompany the Buddha on a tour after the rains, he went to bid his mother farewell, and her admonition to him on that occasion helped him to win insight and become an arahant (Thag.v.82).<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had been a brahmin versed in the Vedas. One day, seeing the Buddha and wishing to pay homage, he cast a handful of sumana-flowers into the air over the Buddha’s head, and the flowers formed a canopy in the sky. In later births he was twenty-five times king, under the name of Cinnamāla (v.l. Cittamāla). (ThagA.i.177f ).<br>He is probably identical with Sereyyaka Thera of the Apadāna.<br>3. Kassapa.-A devaputta. He visited the Buddha late one night at Jetavana and uttered several stanzas, admonishing monks to train themselves in their tasks, laying particular stress on the cultivation of Jhāna (S.i.46).<br>Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.82) that Kassapa had heard the Buddha preach the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa. Having heard only a portion of the doctrine and not being sure of the admonition given by the Buddha to the monks regarding the practice of Jhāna-vibhaṅga, Kassapa thought he could supply the omission. The Buddha, knowing his capabilities, allowed him to give his views, and expressed his approval at the end of Kassapa’s speech.<br>4. Kassapa.-A sage (isi); one of the famous sages of yore, of whom ten are several times mentioned in the books (E.g., D.i.104, 238; M.ii.169, 200; A.iii.224; iv.61; J.vi.99) as having been brahmin sages, who composed and promulgated the mantras and whose compositions are chanted and repeated and rehearsed by the brahmins of the present day. For details see Atthaka.<br>5. Kassapa (called Kassapa-mānava).-The Bodhisatta in the time of Piyadassī Buddha. He was a brahmin versed in the Vedas, and having heard the Buddha preach, built a monastery costing one thousand crores. J.i.38; Bu.xiv.9f; BuA.176.<br>6. Kassapa.-Another name for Akitti (q.v.). J.iv.240, 241; see also Jātakamālā vii.13.<br>7. Kassapa.-A brahmin ascetic, the Bodhisatta, father of Nārada, whose story is given in the Cūla-Nārada Jātaka (q.v.). J.iv.221f.<br>8. Kassapa.-A brahmin ascetic, father of the Bodhisatta in the story of the Kassapamandiya Jātaka. J.iii.38.<br>9. Kassapa.-A great sage, the Bodhisatta, father of Isisinga (J.v.157, 159). The scholiast explains that Kassapa was the gotta or family name.<br>10. Kassapa.-An ascetic, also called Nārada, who lived in a hermitage near Mt. Kosika in Himavā. He saw the Buddha Padumuttara in the forest, invited him into the hermitage, provided a seat and asked for words of advice. He was a former birth of Ekāsanadāyaka Thera. Ap.ii.381.<br>11. Kassapa.-A setthi, probably of Rājagaha, who built the Kassapakārāma, named after him. SA.ii.230.<br>12. Kassapa.-Son of Dhātusena by a morganatic marriage. He slew his father and became king of Ceylon as Kassapa I. (478-96 A.C.). Fearing the revenge of his brother Moggallāna, he erected the fortress at Sīhagiri and dwelt there. Later, repenting of his patricide, he did many meritorious deeds by way of amends (for details see Cv.xxxix.8ff), chief of which was the restoration of the Issarasamāṇārāma, to which he added buildings named after his daughters, Bodhī and Uppalavannā. In a fight with his brother’s forces his army fled in disorder, and Kassapa cut his throat with a dagger. Cv.xxxviii.80ff.; xxxix.1ff.<br>13. Kassapa.-Son of Upatissa III. of Ceylon. He had sixteen companions as brave as himself and, with their help, several times repulsed the attacks of Silākāla, when the latter revolted against the king. He became known as Girikassapa on account of his prowess. In the last campaign Silākāla was victorious, and Kassapa, with his parents and his loyal followers, fled to Merukandara, but they lost their way and were surrounded by Silākāla. When the royal elephant fell Kassapa cut his own throat. Cv.xli.8-25.<br>14. Kassapa.-Younger brother of Aggabodhi III.; he was made viceroy when Māna was killed (Cv.xliv.123f). When Aggabodhi had recovered the kingdom from the usurper Dāthopatissa, which he did only after various reverses in his fortunes, Kassapa abused his influence and plundered various sacred edifices to provide for his army (Cv.xliv.137f). On Aggabodhi’s death in exile in Rohana, Kassapa defeated Dāthopatissa, who claimed the throne, and became king in his place (Kassapa II. 641-50). He did not, however, wear a crown, the regalia having probably been stolen. As king he repented of his former misdeeds and did various acts of merit (Cv.xliv.147ff; xlv.1ff). He paid special honour to Mahādhammakathī Thera of Nāgasālā and to the Thera of Katandhakāra.<br>His children all being young at the time of his death, he entrusted the government to his sister’s son, Māna (Cv.xlv.8). According to the chronicles, Mānavamma was the son of Kassapa (Cv.xlvii.2). He also had a son named Mana (Cv.lvii.4).<br>15. Kassapa (Kassapa III., 717-24 A.C.).-A younger brother of Aggabodhi V. (?); Kassapa’s younger brother was Mahinda I (Cv.xlviii.20-26) and his son Aggabodhi (Cv.xlviii.32).<br>16. Kassapa.-One of the three younger brothers of Sena I., the others being Mahinda and Udaya (Cv.l.6). Kassapa was appointed ādipāda and fought valiantly against the forces of the Pandu king, who was then invading Ceylon, but, finding his efforts of no avail, he fled to Kondivāta (Cv.vv.25ff). He was later killed at Pulatthipura by the orders of the Pandu king (Cv.vv.46). He had four sons, the eldest of whom was named Sena (Cv.vv.47).<br>17. Kassapa.-Son of Kittaggabodhi, ruler of Rohana. When his eldest brother was murdered by his paternal aunt, Kassapa fled to the court of King Sena I., but, later, with Sena’s help, he won his father’s inheritance (Cv.l.54ff). He was probably killed by the Adipāda Kittaggabodhi. Cv.li.96; and Cv.Trs.i.157, n.2.<br>18. Kassapa.-Younger brother of Sena II. and Udaya II. He was Mahādipāda or Yuvarāja under Udaya (Cv.li.91), and later became king as Kassapa IV. (896-913 A.C.) (Cv.lii.1ff). His daughter Sena married Kassapa V. (Cv.li.93)<br>19. Kassapa.-Son of Sena II. The king gave him a special share of his own revenues and a share of the extraordinary revenues of the island (Cv.li.18, 20). Two wives of his are mentioned: Sanghā and Senā (Cv.li.18, 92). He became Yuvarāja under Kassapa IV. and ruled over Dakkhinadesa (Cv.lii.1), and, at the death of the king, he became ruler of Ceylon as Kassapa V. (probably 913-23 A.C.) (Cv.lii.37ff). He is sometimes referred to as the son of the twice-consecrated queen (dvayābhisekajāta), his mother being Sanghā, daughter of Kittaggabodhi (1) and Devā. In inscriptions Kassapa is referred to as Abhaya-Silāmegha-vanna (Cv.Trs.i.165, n.3). He was evidently a learned man, and a Sinhalese Commentary to the Dhammapadaṭṭhakathā is attributed to him (Edited by D. B. Jayatilaka, Colombo 1933). He had one wife, Vajirā (Cv.lii.62), a second, Devā (Cv.lii.64), and a third, Rājinī (Cv.lii.67). He had a son, Siddhattha, who died young, and another, who was given the title of Sakkasenāpati. The latter led an expedition to help the Pandu king against the King of Cola, but he died of plague in Cola (Cv.lii.72-8).<br>20. Kassapa.-Son of Sena V. (Cv.liv.69)<br>21. Kassapa.-Son of Mahinda V. (Cv.lv.10). When Mahinda was captured and taken away by the Colas, the people took charge of the young Kassapa and brought him up. When the boy was twelve years old the Cola king sent an army over to Ceylon to seize him; but this plan was frustrated by the official Kitti, of Makkhakudrūsa, and the minister Buddha, of Māragallaka (Cv.lv.24-9). Kassapa ascended the throne as Vikkamabāhu, but refused to be crowned until he should have conquered the Damilas in his kingdom. While preparations were afoot towards this end, he died of a vātaroga. He reigned twelve years (1029-1041 A.C.). (Cv.lvi.1-6; Cv.Trs.i.190, n.3). He is perhaps to be identified with the prince Kassapa who married Lokitā, cousin of Mahinda V., and by whom he had two sons, Moggallāna and Loka. Cv.lvii.28f; Cv.Trs.i.195, n.3.<br>22. Kassapa.-Chief of the Kesadhātus (q.v.). For some time he carried on the government at Rohana, where he defeated the Damilas. He refused to own allegiance to Kitti (afterwards Vijayabāhu I.), and after six months of rule in Khadiraṅgani, full of resentment that his services against the Damilas had not been recognised, he marched against Kitti and was slain in a battle near Kājaragāma. Cv.lvii.65-75.<br>23. Kassapa.-A prince of Jambudīpa who, during the reign of Parakkamabāhu I. of Ceylon, sent costly gifts to the king of Rāmañña; the Rāmañña king forbade the envoys to land and insulted them. This is mentioned as one of the acts which led Parakkamabāhu to send an expedition against Rāmañña. Cv.lxxvi.28f<br>24. Kassapa Thera.-According to the Gandhavamsa (p.61) he was the author of the Anāgatavamsa and also of the Mohavicchedanī, the Vimaticchedanī and the Buddhavamsa. This Buddhavamsa is evidently not the canonical work of the same name. The Sāsanavamsadīpa (Verse 1204, see also 1221) says that a Kassapa, an inhabitant of Cola, was the author of a Vimativinodanī. The Sāsanavamsa (p.33; see also P.L.C.160) calls this a Vinayatīkā and the author an inhabitant of the Damila country. The Mohavicchedanī is there described as a lakkhaṇagandha (a treatise on grammar?) and is ascribed to another Kassapa.<br>25. Kassapa.-A Kassapa Thera is mentioned in the Sāsanavamsa (p.50) as having been among those responsible for the establishment of the religion in Yonakarattha. He was an inhabitant of Majjhimadesa.<br>26. Kassapa.-The Sāsanavamsa (p.71) mentions a Kassapa Thera of Arimaddana, in the time of King Narapati. While on tour he reached a country called Pollanka, where the people grew very fond of him and where he became known as Pollanka Thera. Some time later he was crossing to Ceylon and the vessel in which he was refused to move. Lots were drawn, as it was necessary to discover who aboard the vessel was the sinner. The lot fell repeatedly on Kassapa, because, in a former life, he had harassed a dog in the water. He was accordingly thrown overboard, but was rescued by Sakka, in the form of a crocodile. The thera reached Yakkhadīpa (q.v.) and there, as a result of practising compassion, the blind yakkhas gained their sight. Kassapa went later to Sīhaladīpa, whence he returned home with relics and seeds of the Bodhi-tree and models of the Mahācetiya and Lohapāsāda.<br>27. Kassapa.-The name is sometimes used as a shortened form of Kassapagotta (q.v.). (E.g., J.vi.224, 225, etc., in reference to the ājīvaka Guna). Nārada-tāpasa is also once addressed as Kassapa (J.vi.58).<br>28.

'kassapa samyutta':['The sixteenth section of the Samyutta Nikāya (S.ii.192-225). It contains various suttas connected with Mahā-Kassapa (q.v. for details). Mahā-Kassapa’s verses in the Theragāthā reflect the sentiments contained in these suttas. The discussion on the lokiya-aspect of the sammappadhānā, as given in the Kassapa Samyutta, is referred to in the commentaries. E.g., VibhA.291.'],

'kassapa-vihāra':['A monastery to which Dāthopatissa II. gave the village of Senāmagāma (Cv.xlv.27). This monastery is probably to be identified with Kassapagiri-vihāra.'],
'kassapagiri':['A monastery in Ceylon. Jetthatissa III. gave the village of Ambilāpika for the supply of food to the monks of Kassapagiri (Cv.xliv.98), and Kassapa III. showed this monastery his special favour (Cv.xlviii.24).<br>The monastery probably formed part of what - in an inscription of Mahinda IV. found at Vessagiris – is called the ”Isuramenu-Bo-Upulvan-Kasubgiri-Vihāra.” It would appear that Kassapa I. founded a great monastic establishment out of the Vessagiri and Issarasamana Vihāras and that this enlarged monastery was named after his two daughters Bodhi and Uppalavannā and also after Kassapa himself. This establishment was evidently referred to briefly as Kassapagiri. (Ep. Zey.i.31ff; i.216; and Cv.Trs.i.43, n.7).<br>The name Kacchapa giri (q.v.) found in the Mahāvamsa Tika (p.652; see also 407, which has Kassapagiri) is apparently a wrong reading for Kassapagiri, in which case the identification is important, for here we have ”Issarasamanasankhāte Kacchapagirivihāre.” See also Kassapavihāra.'],
'kassapagotta':['1. Kassapagotta.-Apparently the general name given to those belonging to the family of Kassapas.

He was in the habit of showing extreme hospitality to the monks who came there from other parts. Once some monks who visited him enjoyed his hospitality and stayed on. After some time, feeling that they had outstayed their welcome, Kassapagotta grew tired of looking after them and was blamed by them for his neglect. He therefore went to Campā, where he laid his case before the Buddha, who declared that no blame attached to him. Vin.i.312ff.<br>3. Kassapagotta.-A monk living in Pankadhā in the Kosala country. He heard the Buddha preach a sermon, but was not satisfied with it and kept on thinking: ”This recluse” (meaning the Buddha) ”is much too scrupulous” (adhisallikhat’evāyam). Later, he was filled with remorse and, having sought the Buddha atRājagaha, begged forgiveness for his thoughtlessness.<br>The Buddha praised him for having seen his transgression, and for his confession thereof and determination to practise self-restraint. A.i.236f<br>4. Kassapagotta.-A monk, perhaps to be identified with one of the foregoing. He was once staying in a forest tract in Kosala and, seeing a trapper pursuing deer, intervened and protested against the man’s earning his living by such cruel means. The trapper was too preoccupied with his quarry to pay much attention to what was said. A deva of the forest drew near the monk and instructed him not to waste his time in preaching to a man who heard but did not understand what was being said. Kassapa was agitated and, according to the Commentary, gave himself up to much striving and became an arahant. S.i.198f; SA.i.223.<br>5.

During the rains the three came down to the haunts of men and at the end of the rainy season returned to the hermitage. The Bodhisatta went on ahead to prepare the hermitage, leaving the father and the younger brother to follow. The lad, finding the father’s progress very slow, tried to hurry him, much to the latter’s annoyance. The two quarrelled, and thus were so late that the Bodhisatta came to look for them. On hearing what had happened, he told the father, who is called Kassapa, that the old should have patience with the young.<br>The story was told in reference to a nobleman of Sāvatthi, who became a monk and who, on his mother’s death, was joined by his father and younger brother. All three went to a village retreat to fetch robes, and things happened as in the past.

It consists of a dialogue between the Buddha and Acela-Kassapa on self-mortification, and contains an account of some of the practices prevalent among the ājīvakas.<br>The Buddha claims that the insight and self-control and self-mastery of the arahant are much harder of attainment than the merely physical practices of the ascetics, which are far more evident to the vulgar. The Buddha states that self-mortification is an actual hindrance to spiritual development, for it turns a man’s mind from more essential matters.<br>It is said that at the conclusion of the Sutta, Kassapa entered the Order and, in due course, became an arahant.

Perhaps this residence was identical with the Katandhakāra mentioned in the Cūlavamsa (Cv.xlv.3). Kassapa II. paid much respect to an Elder of unknown name who lived there. It is said that the king had the sacred texts written down with a short summary in honour of this Elder. Geiger thinks (Cv. Trs.i.89, n.4) that the Padhānaghara called Mahallarāja, which had been erected by Aggabodhi III., brother of Kassapa II., in company with the Yuvarāja Māna, was attached to the Katandhakāra monastery.'],

The boys grew up together, the slave’s son being called Katāhaka. Katāhaka acquired various arts in the company of his master. When he grew up he was appointed as the Treasurer’s private secretary. One day he visited a merchant on the frontier, carrying a letter purporting to be from the Treasurer (in which he was stated to be the son of the latter), asking for the hand of the merchant’s daughter in marriage. The merchant was overjoyed, and the marriage took place. Katāhaka gave himself great airs and spoke contemptuously of everything ”provincial.” The Treasurer, discovering what had happened, decided to visit the merchant, but Katāhaka went to meet him on the way, and paying him all the honour due from a slave, begged him not to expose him. Meanwhile, he had misled his wife’s relations into the belief that the homage, paid by him to the Treasurer, was but the regard due from a son to his father. He was not like the sons of other parents, but knew what was due to his father. The Bodhisatta, being pleased, did not expose the slave, but on learning from Katāhaka’s wife that Katāhaka always complained of his food, he taught her a stanza which contained the threat - not intelligible to her, though clear to Katāhaka - that if Katāhaka continued to make a nuisance of himself, the Treasurer would return and expose him. Thenceforth Katāhaka held his peace.<br>The story was related in reference to a monk who used to boast of his high lineage and the wealth of his family until his pretensions were exposed (J.i.451ff).<br>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.357ff), the story was told in reference to a monk named Tissa who would complain, no matter what attentions were paid to him.'],

'kathāvatthu':['The fifth of the seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. (Sometimes called the third, e.g., in Mbv.94). It seems to have been compiled when the contents of at least the Dhammasaṅganī, the Vibhaṅga and Patthāna were already accepted as orthodox. Tradition ascribes its compilation to Moggaliputta-Tissa at the end of the Third Council, held under Asoka’s patronage; at Pātaliputta (Mhv.v.278; Dpv.vii.41, 56-8). It was rejected by some on the ground that it was set forth two hundred and eighteen years after the Buddha’s death, and was hence only a disciple’s utterance; but the Commentaries take the view that the mātikā, the principles taught therein, were laid down by the Teacher himself, and that the whole work should be regarded as the utterance of the Buddha, just as the Madhu-pindika Sutta, preached really by Mahā-Kaccāna, is considered as the Buddha’s teaching. The book consists of twenty-three chapters, and is a collection of discussions (kathā) and refutations of the heretical views of various sects on matters connected with theology and philosophy. The Buddha’s authority is accepted as final. See the very valuable Preface to the Points of Controversy, by Mrs. Rhys Davids, vii ff See also Rhys Davids on ”Questions discussed in the Kathā-Vatthu,” J.R.A.S.1892.<br>It has sometimes been suggested (E.g., J.R.A.S.1915, 805ff ) that Asoka’s Rock Edict IX. has been influenced by the Kathā-Vatthu.

When the Bodhisatta grew up his playmates nicknamed him ”No-father.” Feeling ashamed, he asked his mother about it and, on hearing the truth, insisted on being taken to the king. When confronted with the child, the king was too shy to acknowledge his parentage, and the mother, having no witness, threw the child into the air with the prayer that he should remain there if her words were true.

'kāka jātaka':['1. Kāka Jātaka (No.140).-The Bodhisatta was once born as a crow. One day a crow dropped filth on the king’s chaplain as he was returning from the bath arrayed in all his splendour. He thereupon conceived hatred against all crows. Soon after that a woman slave, watching some rice spread out in the sun to dry, was angered by a goat who, as soon as she fell asleep, started to eat the rice. In exasperation she fetched a torch and struck the goat’s shaggy back, which caught fire. To ease its pain, the goat ran into the hayshed near the king’s elephant-stalls and rolled in the hay. In the conflagration that ensued many of the elephants were badly burnt, and when the chaplain was consulted, remembering his anger against crows, he said that the cure for burns was crows’ fat. Crows were accordingly being mercilessly slaughtered; the Bodhisatta, hearing of this sought the king and explained to him the chaplain’s motive. Crows had no fat, he said, because their life is passed in ceaseless dread. The king, being greatly pleased with the Bodhisatta’s act, granted immunity to all living beings, showing particular favour towards crows.<br>The circumstances which led to the recital of the story are described in theBhaddasāla Jātaka. The king in the story was Ananda.<br>2. Kāka Jātaka (No.146).-Once a crow came with his mate to the seashore and ate freely of the remnants of a sacrifice which had been offered by men to the Nāgas and drank freely of the strong drink which he found. Both crows became drunk, and, while trying to swim in the surf, the hen-crow was washed into the sea and eaten by a fish. Hearing the husband’s lamentations, many crows gathered together and started to empty the ocean, working away until ready to drop from weariness. Seeing their plight, the Bodhisatta, who was then a sea-sprite, caused a bogey to appear from the sea, frightening them away.<br>The story was told in reference to a number of monks who had joined the Order in their old age. They went for alms to their former wives’ and children’s houses, and gathering together at the house of the wife of one of them (she being particularly beautiful), placed together what each had received and ate it with sauces and curries prepared by the beautiful wife. The woman died, and the aged monks, returning to the monastery, wept aloud for their benefactress, the giver of sauces. The matter was reported to the Buddha, who identified the crows of the past with the foolish monks (J.i.497-9).<br>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.422), the name of the woman was Madhurapācikā.<br>3. Kāka Jātaka (No.395).-The Bodhisatta was once a pigeon and lived in a net basket in the kitchen of a Benares merchant. A greedy crow, becoming intimate with him, came to live there. The cook discovered the crow trying to steal some food, and, pulling out his feathers, sprinkled him with flour, hung a cowry round his neck and flung him into the basket.<br>The story closely resembles those of the Kapota Jātaka and the Lola Jātaka, and is related in reference to a greedy monk (J.iii.314-16; see also Cunningham: Bharhut Stūpa, xlv. Pl.7).<br>The Kapota Jātaka (J.i.241) makes reference to a Kaka Jātaka of the Navani-pāta.

Kākavanna-Tissa gathered round him all the foremost Sinhalese warriors of the time so that they should be available for Gāmani, when the time came for his campaign against the Damilas (Mhv.xxiii.2).<br>But at the start Kākavanna-Tissa was very reluctant to allow his son to make preparations for such a campaign (Mhv.xxii.82f), so much so that, in exasperation, the young prince once sent his father some female ornaments to indicate that the king was no man (Mhv.xxiv.4). Kākavanna-Tissa was very pious, and is said to have built sixty-four vihāras, sixty-four years being also the length of his reign (Mhv.xxiv.12; see also AA.i.279). Among the religious edifices built by him were the Tissamahārāma, the Cittalapabbatavihāra (Mhv.xxii.23) and the Mahānuggala Cetiya. He was cremated at Tissamahārāma (xxiv.8, 13). He evidently received his name on account of his dark colour. The Dīpavamsa (Dpv.xviii.20; were their names Mahilā and Samantā?; see also xix.21f) speaks of Kākavanna-Tissa’s daughters as having been proficient in the history of the, Religion (saddhammavamsakovidā).<br>He was once a milakkka in India and looked after a Pacceka Buddha. One day he gave the Pacceka Buddha a meal of ripe jack-fruit. On another occasion, when the Pacceka Buddha visited his house in his absence, his wife tried to tempt him. Having failed, she complained to the husband that the Pacceka Buddha had assaulted her. The latter sought the Pacceka Buddha to kill him, but, seeing him in mid air putting on his robe, he was filled with wonder and asked the Pacceka Buddha’s forgiveness. Later he was born in a hunters’ village near Amaruppala-lena, his name being Amaruppala, and did various good deeds.<br>He was called Kākavanna-Tissa because he knew the speech of crows. Ras.ii.53f; see also p.64, where a crow announces various things to him.'],
'kākātī jātaka':['Kākātī was the chief queen of the King of Benares (the Bodhisatta). A certainGaruda king came disguised as a man and played at dice with the king. Having fallen in love with Kākātī, the Garuda carried her off to his abode by the Simbalī-Lake and there lived with her. The king, missing his queen, sent his physician, Natakuvera, to look for her. The physician hid himself in the Garuda’s plumage and thus reached the palace where Kākātī was. There he enjoyed her favour and returned to Benares in the Garuda’s wing. While the Garuda and the king were playing at dice, Natakuvera sang a song telling of his experiences with Kākātī. The Garuda, realising what had happened, brought the queen back to Benares.<br>The story was related by the Buddha to a monk who was discontented on account of a woman. The monk is identified with Natakuvera (J.iii.90-2).<br>The story is among those related by the bird Kunāla, in theKunāla Jātaka. There (J.v.428) we learn that the Garuda’s name was Venateyya, who is identified with Kunāla.<br>The Kākātī Jātaka very closely resembles theSussondī Jātaka. J.iii.187ff.'],
'kāla':['A Thera of Ceylon, an arahant. He belonged to a minister’s family and was born in a village near Dakkhinagiri-vihāra. When he came of age, he entered the Order, learned the whole of the Tipitaka, and, on going with a large concourse to see his teacher, was asked to give up his following and go into solitude to practise meditation. He went to the Vātakasitapabbata-vihāra, practised meditation and became an arahant. While living in the Cetiyapabbata-vihāra, he was once worshipping at the Kantaka-cetiya and was seated at the foot of a Kālatimabara tree. (Legend says on the night of the new moon, thus completing the circle of Kālas). One of the monks asked him a question on the Kālakārāma Sutta and the Elder preached a sermon based on the sutta. King Tissa (probably Saddhā-Tissa), who was in the vicinity, came to listen to the sermon, which lasted throughout the night; the king remained standing the whole time. Greatly pleased, the king, at the end of the sermon, offered the sovereignty of Ceylon to the monk.<br>It is said that the Elder had been the Nigantha Mahā-Saccaka in the time of the Buddha, and that the Buddha had preached to him the Mahā-Saccaka Sutta, not because he could understand it then, but because the Buddha knew that it would help him to rise to eminence in this last life as Kāla-Buddharakkhita. MA.i.469f<br>kāla<br>1. Kāla.-Son of Anāthapindika.-As he showed no signs of piety his father, feeling very distressed, made a solemn promise to give him a thousand if he kept the fast-day. Kāla won the money, and the next day he was promised a thousand if he would listen to the Buddha preaching and learn a single verse of the Dhamma. He listened to the Buddha’s sermon, but by the will of the Buddha he could not keep in mind a single verse until the sermon came to an end. He then became asotāpanna and accompanied the Buddha and the monks to his father’s house. There, when in the presence of them all Anāthapindika gave Kāla the money, he refused to accept it, and the Buddha explained what had happened. DhA.iii.189ff<br>2. Kāla.-An Elder. A certain woman ministered to him as though he were her son, but when she expressed her desire to see the Buddha, Kāla tried to dissuade her from doing so. One day she visited the Buddha without telling Kāla of her intention, and when he learnt where she had gone he hurried to the Buddha and tried to prevent him from preaching to her, in case she should stop caring for him. DhA.iii.155f<br>3. Kāla.-Minister ofPasenadi. He was grieved when the king spent his fortune in giving alms to the Buddha and his monks at the Asadisa-dāna; the Buddha, knowing his thoughts, spoke but a single stanza by way of thank offering at the end of the dāna lest Kāla’s head should split in seven pieces in anger. When the king learnt, on inquiry, why the Buddha had so acted, he dismissed Kāla from his service. DA.ii.654f; DhA.iii.186-8; also ii.89.<br>4. Kāla.-An Elder of Kosala.

'kālingabodhi jātaka':['The Kālinga king of Dantapura had two sons, Mahā Kālinga and Culla Kālinga. Soothsayers foretold that the younger would be an ascetic, but that his son would be aCakka-vatti. Knowing of this prophecy, Culla Kālinga became so arrogant that Mahā Kālinga, on coming to the throne, ordered his arrest. But Culla Kālinga fled to Himavā and lived there as an ascetic. Near his hermitage lived the king and queen of Madda who had fled with their daughter from their city of Sāgala. Soothsayers had predicted that the princess’s son would be a Cakka-vatti, and all the kings of Jambudīpa sought her hand. Her parents, not wishing to incur the enmity of any of the kings, fled with her from the city. One day a wreath of mango-flowers which the princess dropped into the river was picked up by Culla Kālinga, who thereupon went in search of her. With her parents’ consent he married her, and to these two was born a son whom they called Kālinga.<br>When the stars revealed that Mahā Kālinga had died, Kālinga was sent to Dantapura, to a courtier who had been an ally of Culla Kālinga. The prince’s identity having been duly established, he was crowned king, and his chaplain, Kālinga-bhāradvāja, taught him the duties of a Cakka-vatti. On the fifteenth day after his coronation, the tokens of a Cakka-vatti king appeared before him. (For details see J.iv.232). One day while riding through the air with his retinue, he came to the Bodhi-tree under which Buddhas attain Enlightenment, and though he prodded his elephant until it died the animal found it impossible to fly over the spot. The royal chaplain investigated matters and reported his finding to the king who, having learnt from the chaplain of a Buddha’s virtues, paid great honour to the tree for seven days. See also Samanakolañña.<br>Kālinga is identified with Ananda and Kālinga-bhāradvāja with the Bodhisatta.<br>The story was related in reference to the Bodhi-tree planted, at Ananda’s suggestion, by Anāthapindika, at the entrance to Jetavana, in order that people might worship it while the Buddha was away on tour. As soon as a seedling was planted from the great Bodhi-tree at Gayā, it grew into a tree fifty cubits high, and the Buddha consecrated it by spending one night under it, wrapt in meditation (J.iv.228-36).<br>The Kālingabodhi Jātaka is found also in theMahābodhi-vamsa (Mbv.62ff ); there it is given in much greater detail and differs in minor details from the Jātaka version, containing, among other things, a long description of dibba-cakkhu and the seven gems of a Cakka-vatti.'],
'kālī sutta':['Kālī Kururaghara visits Mahā-Kaccāna and asks him for a detailed exposition of one of the stanzas in the Kumāripañhas. (The stanza occurs at S.i.126). Mahā-Kaccāna explains, and his explanation deals with the ten kasinas. A.v.46f'],
'kāludāyī thera':['Son of one of Suddhodana’s ministers atKapilavatthu; he was born on the same day as theBuddha and grew up as his playfellow. AfterGotama left the world, Suddhodana made Kāludāyī one of his most trusted counsellors. When the king heard of his son’s Enlightenment he sent several of his ministers with large retinues to bring the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, but they all became arahants as soon as they heard the Buddha’s preaching and then forgot their mission. In the end the king sent Kāludāyī, on the understanding that he should first be allowed to join the Order. (According to Mtu.iii.233, he was accompanied byChanna in this mission). He went to the Buddha and, having listened to him, himself became an arahant. When the rains fell, covering the earth with the glory of leaves and flowers, Kāludāyī felt that it was time for the Buddha to visit his kinsmen, and gave him their invitation, singing the season’s beauties in a series of verses. The Buddha took sixty days in covering the sixty leagues from Rājagaha to Kapilavatthu, and each day Kāludāyī went by air to the king’s palace to tell him of the progress made in the journey and to bring back to the Buddha from the palace a bowl full of excellent food. By the time the Buddha reached his home his kinsmen were already full of faith in him. Because Kāludāyī accomplished this feat, he was declared pre-eminent among those who gladdened the clans (kulappasādakānam aggo) (A.i.25; Thag.527-36; J.i.54, 86f; AA.i.107, 117; ThagA.i.497ff; UdA.168; DA.ii.425).<br>It is said that he was called Udāyī because he was born on a day on which the citizens were full of joy (udaggacittadivase jātattā); and called Kāla because of his slightly dark colour. AA.i.167; ThagA.i.498.<br>According to the Apadāna (ii.500f; see also Ap.i.86f, where another set of verses is attributed to Kāludāyī), Kāludāyī had been the son of a minister of Hamsavatī during the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and having heard the Buddha utter the praises of a monk skilled in converting families, had wished for the same eminence.<br>The Anguttara Nikāya (A.iv.449f) records a conversation between Udāyī (who, according to Buddhaghosa (AA.ii.815), is to be identified with Kāludāyī) and Ananda. Udāyī asks Ananda to explain in detail a question which is recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.48) as having been asked of the Buddha by Pañcālacanda-devaputta (see Pañcāla Sutta).<br>The Dhammapada Commentary (iv.143) refers to an assembly at which Kāludāyī was present, his body of golden hue, sitting near Pasenadi, at sunset, with the moon rising in the eastern sky. Ananda looks at them and declares how the Buddha suffuses them all with his glory.<br>Kāludāyī is identified with Sakka in theBhisa Jātaka (J.iv.314).'],

'kāma jātaka':['Brahmadatta, king of Benares, had two sons. When he died the elder refused the crown and retired into a frontier village. The people there, discovering his identity, offered to pay their taxes to him instead of to the king, and the king, at his request, agreed.<br>As his power increased, the prince became more covetous and demanded the kingdom, which the younger brother gladly renounced. But the elder’s greed was insatiable, and Sakka, to teach him a lesson, came in the guise of a young man and offered to capture for him three cities. The king made up his mind to accept the offer; but, then the young man could not be found, and the king fell ill of greed.<br>The Bodhisatta, just returned from Takkasilā, heard of this, and having obtained the king’s leave to treat him, cured him of this disease by showing him the futility of his wishes. Thereafter the king became a righteous ruler (J.iv.167ff).<br>The story was told in reference to the brahmin to whom theKāma Sutta was preached. TheKāmanīta Jātaka was also preached in this connection.'],
'kāma sutta':['1. Kāma Sutta-The first of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipāta. The Buddha, seeing a brahmin felling trees on the banks of the Aciravatī and preparing a field for corn, spoke to him. He spoke again to the brahmin on several other occasions, when the latter was engaged in various operations in the field. The brahmin, pleased by the Buddha’s courtesy, resolved to invite him to a meal when the harvest should be gathered. But the day before the reaping of the corn heavy rains fell, the river was flooded and the corn all washed away. The Buddha had foreseen that this would happen and visited the brahmin to console him. It was on this last occasion that this sutta was preached. At the end of the sermon the brahmin became a sotāpanna (Sn.vv.766-71; SnA.ii.511ff; J.iv.167f; cp. DhA.iii.284f; see also MNid.i.1ff).

'kāmabhū sutta':['1. Kāmabhū Sutta.-Kāmabhū visits Ananda at Ghositārāma in Kosambī and asks him whether the senses are the bonds of objects or objects the bonds of senses. Ananda answers that neither is true; the bond is the desire and lust that arise owing to the senses and the objects with which they come in contact. The Buddha, for instance, is free from such bondage (S.iv.165).<br>The same question is asked of Sāriputta by Kotthita, who receives the same reply (S.iv.162f).<br>2. Kāmabhū Sutta.-Cittagahapati visits Kāmabhū at Ambātakavana in Macchikāsanda and is asked to solve a riddle:<br>Nelango setapacchādo ekāro vattatī ratho Anīgham passa āyantam chinnasotam abandhanam.Citta explains this as referring to the Arahant and points out the significance of each term (S.iv.291f).

'kāṇā':['Daughter of Kānamātā. After she married she visited her mother, and one day, while she was there, her husband sent for her. Her mother, not wishing her to return empty-handed, asked her to wait till she had made some cakes. When the cakes were ready, a monk came to the door and Kānā gave him some. Four other monks came, and the cakes were finished. Four times Kānā’s husband sent for her and four times the same thing happened. So, in anger, the husband took another wife. Kānā, learning this, was so greatly annoyed that she reviled and abused every monk she saw until no monk dared go into her street. The Buddha, hearing of this, visited Kānā’s mother, and having finished his meal there, sent for Kānā, argued with her, and convinced her that the monks were not to blame inasmuch as they had only taken what was given them. At the end of the Buddha’s discourse Kānā became a sotāpanna. The king saw the Buddha returning from Kānā’s home and, on learning what had happened, sent for her, adopted her as his daughter, and arranged for her marriage with a rich nobleman. Thenceforward Kānā’s generosity to the monks became proverbial. Vin.iv.78f; DhA.ii.149ff; the Samantapāsādikā (iv.819) gives a somewhat different account; there, when Kānā’s husband heard that the Buddha had been to see her, he sent for her and she returned.<br>It was on Kānā’s account that the Babbu Jātaka (J.i.477f) was preached.

Samuddajā threw him on to the ground with a shriek and accidentally struck his eye with her nail, thereby blinding him. Henceforth he, whose name had been Arittha, was known as Kānārittha (J.vi.168). When, after Bhūridatta’s disappearance (see Bhūridatta Jātaka) from the Nāga-world, his brothers set out to search for him, Kānārittha was sent to the world of the gods, for he was so cruel by nature that they knew that if he went to the world of men he would destroy it by fire (J.vi.190). When, after his search, he returned to the Nāga-world, he was appointed doorkeeper of Bhūridatta’s sick-room; there, seeing Subhaga dragging a brahmin roughly into the Nāga-world, he prevented him from ill-treating the man and told him of the greatness of all brahmins, illustrating his words with various stories (J.vi.197; details see pp.200ff). It is said that in his immediately preceding birth, he had been a brahmin, well-versed in sacrificial lore. Bhūridatta heard (from his bed) Arittha’s undue praise of brahmins and refuted his statements (J.vi.205ff).<br>Kānārittha is identified with Sunakkhatta (J.vi.219).'],
'kāñcipura':['A city in Southern India on the Coromandel coast, capital of the Pallavas, and one of the seven sacred towns of India; it is the modern Conjevaram.

He mentions that during his stay there three hundred monks came to Kāñcipura from Ceylon, fleeing from the political disturbances in that country (Beal, op. cit., ii.228f; CAGI.627). In Pali Literature the locality is noteworthy as the birthplace of the Commentator Dhammapāla and perhaps also of Anuruddha, author of the Abhidhammattha-Saṅgaha (P.L.C.113, 169). Some identify Kāñcipura with Satiyaputta of Asoka’s Rock Edict II. E.g., J.R.A.S., 1918, 541f; see also Bhandarkar, Anct. Hist. of Deccan pp.47, 52.'],

The Buddha, knowing that Kāpathika had questions to ask of him, gave him an opportunity for so doing, and there followed a discussion on various points, detailed in theCankī Sutta. At the end of the discussion the youth declared himself a disciple of the Buddha (M.ii.168ff).<br>In the Sutta the Buddha addresses Kāpathika as Bhāradvāja, perhaps because he belonged to that gotta.'],

On the way back Kārandiya saw a cave and started throwing stones into it. Told of this by the other boys, the teacher questioned Kārandiya, who replied that it was his ambition to make the whole world level.

'kāsi':['1. Kāsi (Kāsika).-One of the sixteenMahājanapadas (A.i.213, etc.), its capital being Bārānasī.<br>At the time of the Buddha, it had been absorbed into the kingdom of Kosala, andPasenadi was king of both countries (D.i.288; M.ii.111). The Mahāvagga (Vin.i.28l), however, mentions a Kāsika-rājā (king of Kāsi?) who sent a robe to Jīvaka. Buddhaghosa (see Vinaya Texts ii.195, n.2) says that this was a brother of Pasenadi and son of the same father. He was probably a sub-king of Pasenadi. Pasenadi’s father,Mahākosala, on giving his daughter in marriage to Bimbisāra, allotted her a village of Kāsi (Kāsigāma) as bath money (J.iv.342; J.ii.403; SA.i.110,120f, etc.).<br>Even at this time, however, the memory of Kāsi as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men’s minds. It is very frequently mentioned as such in the Jātakas and elsewhere. Kāsi was once ruled by theBhāratas, one of whom,Dhatarattha, was its king in the time ofRenu (D.ii.235f). There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kāsi and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other. In one such war, Dīghāti, the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of Kāsi, but Dīghīti’s son Dīghāvu won back the kingdom (Vin.i.334; J.iii.487; DhA.i.46). In another war the Kāsi king,Mahāsīlava, was taken captive by the ruler of Kosala, but his kingdom was later restored to him (J.i.262, etc.; see also i.409; UdA.123).<br>The traditional name of the king of Kāsi from time immemorial was evidentlyBrahmadatta, and references to kings of that name abound in the Jātakas. Sometimes the king is referred to merely as Kāsi-rājā. Among other kings of Kāsi mentioned are Kikī (M.ii.49) and Kalābu (J.iii.39). The extent of the Kāsi kingdom is given as three hundred leagues (J.v.41; also iii.304, 391).<br>The capital of Kāsi is generally given as Bārānasī, but it is said that when Asoka was king of Kāsi his capital was in Potali (J.iii.155), and another king, Udaya-bhadda, had his seat of government in Surundha (J.iv.104ff). It is possible that these cities did not form part of the regular kingdom of Kāsi, but became annexed to it during the reigns of some of the more powerful kings.<br>Kāsi was evidently a great centre of trade and a most populous and prosperous country. Frequent mention is made of caravans leaving Kāsi to travel for trade. One highway went through Kāsi to Rājagaha (Vin.i.212) and another to Sāvatthi (Vin.ii.10; Mhv.v.114). Kāsi was famed for her silks, and Kāsi-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts, each robe being valued at one hundred thousand. (See, e.g., J.vi.151, 450; see also Addhakāsi). Mention is also made of the perfumes of Kāsi (Kāsi-vilepana (J.i.355) and Kāsi-candana (A.iii.391; UdA.332)).<br>Besides those already referred to, other names of places mentioned in literature as belonging to Kāsi, are Vāsabhagāma, Macchikāsanda (the kammantagāma of Anāthapindika),Kītāgiri and Dhammapālagāma.<br>Kāsi and Kosala are frequently mentioned together. (E.g., A.v.59).<br>2. Kāsi, or Kāsika.-A city, the birthplace of Phussa Buddha (Bu.xix.14; J.i.41). There he preached the Buddhavamsa (BuA.193).

When his friend Sāmaññakāni joined the Order, he followed his example and exerted himself in meditation, sleeping but little. One night, overcome by sleep, he fell on the terrace where he was pacing to and fro, and the Buddha, seeing him, went himself to help him and urged him not to give up his efforts but to concentrate and contemplate. Aided by this admonition, Kātiyāna soon became an arahant. The Buddha’s sermon is included in the Theragāthā (Thag.vv.411-16; ThagA.i.450f).<br>From the story of Sāmaññakāni, given in the Theragāthā Commentary (i, p.99f), it would appear that Kātiyāna was, for some time, a Paribbājaka.

The servant girl, who was sent to fetch oil for lighting the lamps, brought news of the presence of the thieves, but Kātiyāni refused to leave until the thera’s sermon should be finished. The leader of the thieves, who had watched the incident, was so pleased with her that he gave orders that all the goods stolen from her house should be restored. At the end of the sermon Kātiyāni became a sotāpanna. The next day the thieves came and asked her forgiveness. She took them to the Elder, who ordained them, and there they all became arahants.

It is sixty leagues in breadth, and āḷavaka, on his way to his house, having heard to his great anger that the Buddha was there, placed his left foot on Manosilātala and his right on Kelāsakūta. The touch of his foot sent pieces of the rock flying, and his shout ”I am āḷavaka” was heard throughout Jambudīpa (SNA.i.223; SA.i.248).<br>Kelāsa is often used in similes to describe an object that is perfectly white (E.g., J.iv.232; vi.490, 515; the horse Kanthaka, Mbv.26; DhA.i.192; Cv.lxxiii.114), very stately (E.g., an elephant’s head or a big building, J.i.321; v.52, 53; Cv.lxxviii.77), or difficult to destroy (E.g., J.v.39).<br>In the Mahāvastu (ii.97, 109; see also iii.309, 438), Kailāsa is mentioned as the abode of the Kinnaras.<br>In Sanskrit mythology, Kailāsa is given as the abode of the gods, chiefly Siva and Kubera.

'kelisīla jātaka':['Brahmadatta, king of Benares, could not look upon anyone old or decrepit without playing jokes on them. He made old men roll about on the ground and played practical jokes on old women. His friends behaved likewise. All old people left his country; no parents or aged persons remained to be tended by the young, and newcomers among the gods were few in number. Sakka (the Bodhisatta), wishing to teach the king a lesson, once appeared before him in the guise of an old man, with two jars of butter milk in a crazy old cart, having willed that only the king should be able to see him. The king was riding his state elephant, and when he asked the old tarter to move the latter dashed the two jars on the king’s head and the onlookers laughed to see the milk dripping down his face.

The following day he invited the whole company to a meal and showed great hospitality. It was as a result of the drinks offered by Keniya that the Buddha laid down a rule as to which drinks were permissible for monks and which were not (Vin.i.245f).<br>According to the Sutta Nipāta (p.104; M.ii.146f; see also ThagA.ii.47), it was owing to the elaborate preparations made by Keniya for the meal to the Buddha and the Sangha that the brahmin Sela, friend and counsellor of Keniya, came to discover the Buddha’s presence in āpaṇa. The result was the conversion and ordination of Sela and his three hundred pupils.<br>Buddhaghosa says (SNA.ii.440; MA.ii.779; Ap.i.318) that Keniya was a mahāsāla-brahmin, and that he became a Jatila with the object of protecting his wealth. He bought some land from the king and built his hermitage there, and became the protector (nissaya) of one thousand families. In his hermitage was a palm tree which yielded a golden nut each day. Keniya was a yellow-robed ascetic by day; by night he enjoyed the pleasures of the senses. On his first visit to the Buddha he took five hundred pingo-loads of badarapāna (SNA.ii.446) (? grape juice).<br>Keniya is mentioned (E.g., DA.i.270; see also DhA.i.323; UdA.241) as an example of one of the eight classes of ascetics - those who maintain wife and children (sa-puttabhariya).<br>2.

Later, when Parakkamabāhu’s forces were employed in Rohana, the Kerala mercenaries in Kotthasāra conspired with others to capture Rājarattha, but their attempt was foiled (Cv.lxxiv.44f). The Keralas formed the largest part of Māgha’s army which devastated Ceylon, and Māgha gave over to them, for their use, whatever they coveted in the conquered territory. They overran the country, carrying destruction wherever they went (Cv.lxxx.61, 76; lxxi.4). Later, however, they suffered severe defeat at the hands of Parakkamabāhu II (Cv.lxxxiii.20).

Kesava fell ill of loneliness, and the five physicians of the king could not cure him.

One day he discovered that the monks would take the food from the palace, but would eat that which was given to them elsewhere by those who served them because they loved them. When the king reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha pointed out to him that the best food was that which was given in love; love was the best flavouring for food (J.iii.142-5; iii.362; S.i.144; SA.i.165).<br>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.342ff), the king personally looked after the monks for seven days, after which he forgot about them and they were uncared for.

Soon after, Kappa went away, and it was then that Kesava fell ill.<br>Kesava is identified with the Bodhisatta, Kappa with Ananda, the king of Benares with Moggallāna, and Nārada with Sāriputta.<br>It was this reluctance of the Sākyan monks to accept Pasenadi’s hospitality which led him to seek marriage with a Sākyan maiden; but the Sākyans gave him Vāsabhakhattiyā (q.v.).'],

Some he tames by mildness - telling them what is good and showing them the way to heaven; others by harshness - condemning the evils in them; yet others by both. Those who do not submit to this discipline he destroys, by refusing to admonish them (A.ii.112f).<br>Buddhaghosa says (Sp.i.120) that the Kesi Sutta should be one of those used to explain the term purisadamma-sārathī in reference to the Buddha.'],

Kevatta (1) visits the Buddha and asks him to order a monk to perform some mystic wonder in order to increase the faith of the Buddha’s followers.<br>The Buddha expresses his hatred of miracles and tells Kevatta that a greater and better wonder than any or all of them is education in the system of self-training which culminates in Arahantship. In illustration of this, he relates a legend: A monk, seeking the answer to the question ”Where do the elements pass away?” goes up and up, by the power of his iddhi, from world to world, asking the gods for an answer. In each heaven he is referred to those who are higher up, until he comes at last to the Great Brahmā himself, who takes him aside and tells him that he does not know the answer.<br>The monk seeks the Buddha, who explains to him that the question is wrongly put; it should be, ”Where do the elements find no foothold; where donāma and rūpa pass away?” And the answer is, ”In the mind of the arahant, when intellect (viññāna) ceases, then nāma and rūpa cease.” D.i.211ff; cp.

Kevatta.-Chaplain of Cūlani-Brahmadatta, king of Uttarapañcāla. He was wise and learned and clever in device; the king followed his counsel and conquered all the territories of India except that of King Videha inMithilā (J.vi.391-5). When at last Brahmadatta laid siege to Mithilā, Kevatta was responsible for the details of the siege, but his plans were upset by Mahosadha, who, though his junior in age, was far wiser. At one stage of the struggle Kevatta suggested that a trial of intellect be arranged between him and Mahosadha, the result of the conquest to decide the victory of Brahmadatta or Videha. The challenge was accepted, but Mahosadha, by a ruse, made Kevatta appear as though paying obeisance to him and rubbed Kevatta’s head in the dust, bruising it. After the return, in disgrace, of Brahmadatta to Uttarapañcāla, Kevatta meditated revenge through the instrumentality of Pañcāla-candī. Kevatta visited Mithilā with a proposal that Videha should go to Uttarapañcāla and marry Pañcālacandī. During this visit, Kevatta went to visit Mahosadha, but the latter, guessing that the whole thing was a plot to kill Videha, refused to see Kevatta and caused him to be ill-treated (J.vi.400-19).

When the Treasurer heard of this, he took the bowl of food himself and stepped into the pit, ready to die rather than to have his alms-giving thwarted. A lotus sprang up to receive his foot, the pit vanished, and Māra, discomfited, vanished.<br>The story was related to Anāthapindika.<br>A devatā, who lived in the upper storey of his palace, had to come with her children down to the ground floor whenever the Buddha visited Anāthapindika.

At last, when as a result of his extreme piety Anāthapindika’s wealth was exhausted, the devatā ventured to approach him and warn him of his impending ruin if he did not take heed. He ordered her out of the house, and she had, perforce, to obey. In despair she sought the aid of Sakka, who suggested that she should recover for the merchant all his debts, and reveal to him his hidden treasure which had been lost sight of. She did so, but Anāthapindika, before consenting to pardon her, took her to the Buddha, who then related this Jātaka. The Velāmaka Sutta was also preached on this occasion (J.i.226-34; see also theVisayha Jātaka). For a continuation of the story see the Siri Jātaka.<br>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.447) the Khadirangāra Jākata was preached in reference to the two friends Sirigutta and Gharadinna.

'khaggavisāna sutta':['The third sutta of the Uraga Vagga of the Sutta Nipāta (SN.vv.35-75), consisting of forty-one stanzas, each of which ends with the refrain: ”eko care khaggavisānakappo.”<br>The Commentary (SNA.i.46ff) divides the sutta into four vaggas and gives each a separate name (except the first), the name being generally derived from the first word of the stanza. It is said that the Buddha preached the Khaggavisāna Sutta in response to a question asked of him by Ananda regarding the attainment of Enlightenment by Pacceka Buddhas; the Buddha gave details of their abhinīhara and patthanā, and illustrated them by reciting to Ananda stanzas which had been uttered by Pacceka Buddhas of old on various occasions and at different periods as their paeans of joy (udāna).<br>Buddhaghosa gives the life-story of each of the Pacceka Buddhas whose stanzas are included in this sutta. It is, however, only in the case of a few Pacceka Buddhas that the actual names are given - e.g.,<br>Brahmadatta (v.33), Anitthigandha (36), Mahāpaduma (39), Ekavajjika-Brahmadatta (40), Ekaputtika-Brahmadatta (41), Cātumāsika-Brahma-datta (44, 64), Sītāluka-Brahmadatta (52), Suta-Brahmadatta (58), Vibhūsaka-Brahmadatta (59), Pādalola-Brahmadatta (61), Anivatta-Brahmadatta (62), Cakkhulola-Brahmadatta (63), Mātaṅga (74).The rest are described as ”the king of Benares,” or ”the son of the king,” etc.<br>The sutta is commented on in the Culla-Niddesa (pp.56ff), in addition to those of the Parāyanavagga, an evidence of the fact that, when the Culla-Niddesa was composed, this was probably regarded as an independent sutta, not belonging to any particular group such as the Uragavagga, and that the comments on it were written at a time prior to the composition of the Sutta Nipāta as an anthology in its present form. This view is further strengthened by the fact that its mixed Sanskrit version in the Mahāvastu (i.357f) is not placed in any definite group. According to the Mahāvastu, the Pratyeka Buddhas, five hundred in number, were living in Rsipatana near Benares, and when they heard from the Suddhāvāsa devas of the approach of the Buddha in twelve years, they disappeared from Rsipatana, each repeating one of the verses of the sutta.<br>The Apadāna (i.7ff) includes the stanzas of the Khaggavisāna Sutta in its chapter called the Pacceka-buddhāpadāna and prefaces them with several introductory stanzas. A few stanzas are also added at the end by way of conclusion. In its exegesis the Apadāna Commentary (ApA.i.106f) gives the names of several Pacceka Buddhas. They are, however, different from those given by Buddhaghosa, and correspond more nearly to those mentioned in the Isigili Sutta.'],

S.iii.86-91; this sutta is wrongly titled Sīha in the Samyutta text; see KS.iii.72, n.3.<br>The sutta was also preached by Mahinda in the Nandana grove on the fifth day of his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xv.195).<br>In the Vibhaṅga Commentary (VibhA.32) the sutta is referred to as the Khajja-nīyapariyāya.'],
'khajjopanaka':['When, as a result of the conspiracy of Senaka and the other ministers of Vedeha, Mahosadha was compelled to flee from the Court and live as a potter outside the city gates, the devatā of the king’s parasol, wishing to see him reinstated, appeared to the king and put to him several questions. The king consulted Senaka and his colleagues, but they could find no solution. The deity appeared again to him and said he was like a man who, wanting a fire, blows a firefly, crumbling over it cow-dung and grass, or, wanting milk, milks the cow’s horn. She then threatened the king with death if her questions were not answered. In despair, the king sent for Mahosadha (J.vi.371f).<br>It is evidently this story which is mentioned elsewhere (J.iii.197) as a separate Jātaka, but no details are given, and the reader is referred to the Khajjopanaka-Pañha.'],

Khandahāla hoped thereby to bring about the death of Candakumāra.<br>Ekarājā accepted the suggestion and made all preparations for the sacrifice. Several times the king wavered in his resolve, being interceded with by his parents, Canda and his wives, and the people. Khandahāla goaded him on, but at the moment when the sword was about to descend on the neck of Candakumāra, the latter’s wife, Candā, daughter of the Pañcāla king, made an ”act of truth,” and Sakka appeared, brandishing a thunderbolt. Canda was saved, the crowd killed Khandahāla, and would have killed the king too but for the intervention of Sakka. The king was made an outcast and banished from the city, and Candakumāra, now the crowned king, supplied all his wants. (J.vi.129-57; the story is also found in the Cariyāpitaka as the Candakumāra-cariyā).<br>Khandahāla is identified with Devadatta, Candā with Rāhulamātā, and Candakumāra with the Bodhisatta.<br>The story was told in reference to Devadatta’s attempts to kill the Buddha by engaging the services of archers to shoot him.<br>The story is referred to as an example of a husband being saved by the virtue of his wife (J.iv.47), and also of one instance of Devadatta having greater power than the Bodhisatta (Mil.203).<br>The Jātaka is sometimes called the Candakumāra Jātaka.<br>'],

Once, when he lay very ill at the Badarikārāmā, near Kosambī, some monks, staying at the Ghositārāma, sent one of their number, Dāsaka, with a message to Khemaka, inquiring whether he managed to bear his pains. Dāsaka returned with the reply that he did not; he was sent again to ask if Khemaka had seen the self in the five khandhas; when Dāsaka returned with the answer that he had not, he was sent a third time to ask whether Khemaka was an arahant. ”No,” came the answer, and Dāsaka had to visit him a fourth time with the inquiry, What did Khemaka mean by self? In exasperation Khemaka came himself to Ghositārāma and explained how, even when the Noble Disciple has put away the five lower fetters, there still clings to him a subtle remnant of the ”I” conceit. It is said that as a result of the sermon Khemaka himself and sixty others became arahants (S.iii.126ff).<br>The Commentary (SA.ii.230f) explains that the monks wished to hear Khemaka because they knew his ability, and they also knew that if they showed keenness to learn he would come to them.

Kikī was at first hurt by the refusal, but when the Buddha described Ghatīkāra’s virtues, the king was pleased and sent five hundred cartloads of provisions to Ghatīkāra who, however, curtly refused the gift (D.ii.7; M.ii.49ff).<br>One of Kikī’s daughters was Uracchadā, who attained arahantship at the age of sixteen.

The Theragāthā Commentary says (ThagA.i.235f; Thag.118, 155f, According to DhA.i.117, Kimbila became an arahant soon after ordination together with Bhagu; see also J.i.140 and AA.i.108) that while at Anupiyā the Buddha, in order to arouse Kimbila, conjured up a beautiful woman in her prime and then showed her to him passing into old age. Greatly agitated, Kimbila sought the Buddha, heard the Doctrine and, having entered the Order, in due course won arahantship. Kimbila seems to have maintained throughout his early friendship with Anuruddha, dwelling with him and Nandiya, now in this wood or park, now in that. The Buddha visited them at Pācīna-vamsadāya when he was going away, disgusted with the recalcitrant monks of Kosambī. (Vin.i.350; J.iii.489; see also Upakkilesa Sutta, M.iii.155ff and ThagA.i.275f). They were in the Gosingasālavana when the Buddha preached to them the Cūla-Gosinga Sutta, at the conclusion of which, Dīgha Parajana Yakkha sang the praises of all three (M.i.205ff). Their number was increased by the presence of Bhagu, Kundadhāna, Revata and Ananda, on the occasion when the Buddha preached the Nalakapāna Sutta in the Palāsavana at Nalakapāna (M.i.462ff).<br>In three different places in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.247; 339; iv.84) record is made of a conversation between Kimbila and the Buddha, when Kimbila asks how the Dhamma could be made to endure long after the Buddha’s death and what were the causes which might bring about its early disappearance. The conversation took place in the Veluvana (Niceluvana?) in Kimbilā. According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.ii.642), however, it would appear that the Kimbila mentioned here was not Kimbila the Sākyan but another. We are told that this Kimbila was a setthiputta of Kimbilā. He joined the Order and acquired the power of knowing his previous births. He recollected how he had been a monk at the time when Kassapa Buddha’s religion was falling into decay, and seeing how the Faith was neglected by its followers, he made a stairway up a cliff and lived there as a recluse. It was this memory of his previous life which prompted Kimbila’s question.<br>Elsewhere (S.v.322f ) the Buddha is reported as questioning Kimbila at the same spot on the question of breathing. Kimbila remains silent though the question is put three times. Ananda intervenes and suggests that the Buddha should himself furnish the answer so that the monks may learn it and profit thereby.<br>In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, Kimbila had been a householder; after the Buddha’s death he erected a pavilion of salala-garlands round his cetiya (ThagA.i.235). He is probably to be identified with Salalamandapiya Thera of the Apadāna (Ap.i.333).<br>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.115; iv.126) mentions a story which shows how delicately nurtured Kimbila was. One day, in a discussion with his friends, Anuruddha and Bhaddiya, as to where rice came from, Kimbila remarked that it came from the granary (kotthe).<br>2.

The city existed in the time of Kassapa Buddha and was the residence of the woman who later became Kannamuṇḍapetī (Pv.12; PvA.151). Among the palaces seen by Nimi when he visited heaven was that of a deva who had been a very pious man of Kimbilā (J.vi.121).

Sāriputta desired him to hear an exposition by the Buddha, hence his question (SnA.i.331).<br>One who aspires to the highest good should not be envious, obstiṇate, or careless, but diligent in his training, cultivating self-restraint and chastity, intent in the dhamma, making the dhamma his first and last concern (Sn.pp.56f).<br>This sutta is the ninth of the Culla Vagga of the Sutta Nipāta, and derives its name from the first word (kimsilo) in Sāriputta’s question.'],

A certain courtesan of the city walking about in the park, having lost the king’s favour, saw Kisa-Vaccha, and considering the sight an ill-omen, she spat on him and threw her tooth stick at his head. That same day she received again the patronage of the king and decided that it was as a result of spitting on the hermit. Later, when the purohita lost his office, she advised him to do as she had done, and by coincidence he, too, was restored. Some time after, the king going to quell a border rising, was advised to spit on the ascetic and throw his tooth stick at him; in this way he would find good luck. The king followed this advice, all his soldiers doing likewise. The king’s general, a supporter of Kisa-Vaccha, bathed the holy man, and on being told that the Gods would destroy the kingdom unless apology were made, urged the king to apologise. The king was, however, unwilling, and the whole tract of Kalinga, sixty leagues in extent, was turned into a waste; only three people escaped unhurt - Kisa-Vaccha, the king’s general, and Matuposaka Rāma. Kisa-Vaccha himself was taken in a palanquin to Sarabhaṅga by two of Sarabhaṅga’s pupils (J.iii.463, 469; v.133-6; MA.ii.599ff).<br>The story was evidently well known in India and is often referred to (E.g., J.v.267; DA.i.266).<br>Kisa-Vaccha is mentioned in a list of eleven sages (E .g., J.vi.99).

'kisāgotamī':['1. Kisāgotamī Therī.-An arahant. She was declared chief among women disciples with respect to the wearing of coarse robes (lūkhacīvara-dharānam) (A.i.25; the DhA.iv.156 contains a story of the Buddha speaking to Sakka the praises of Kisāgotamī). She came from a poor family in Sāvatthi (of a setthikula, which had fallen on evil days, says the Apadāna p.565, vs.19). Gotamī was her name - she was called Kisā because of her thinness. She was married into a rich family, by whom she was disdainfully treated; but as soon as she bore a son she was shown respect.<br>(Except by her husband says the Apadāna loc. cit.20. The DhA.ii.270ff account, however, makes no mention of her ill treatment; on the contrary, it leads us to expect that she should have been greatly esteemed because, prior to her arrival, her father-in-law’s wealth, forty crores in amount, had all turned into charcoal. When she touched the charcoal it once more became gold. This account is found also in SA.i.149).<br>The boy, however, died when just old enough to run about; his mother, distraught with grief, fearful lest the dead child should be taken from her, went about with him on her hip, seeking medicine to revive his life. People laughed at her, until one wise man, realizing her condition, directed her to the Buddha. The Buddha asked her to bring him a mustard seed from a house where no one had yet died. In the course of her search for the impossible her frenzy left her, and having grasped the truth, she laid the child in the charnel field, and returning to the Master begged admission to the Order. She became a Sotāpanna, and soon after, when her insight was developed, the Buddha appeared before her in a blaze of radiance and, listening to his words, she became an arahant. (ThigA.174ff; Ap.ii.564f; DhA.i.270ff; AA.i.205).<br>In the verses ascribed to her in the Therīgāthā (vv.213-23), she incorporates the story of Patācārā in her own psalm, as though to utter more fully the pageant and tragedy inherent in woman’s lot, whereof her own sorrow was but a phase.<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha she was a householder’s daughter in Hamsavatī, and having heard the Buddha assign to a bhikkhunī the foremost rank among wearers of coarse robes, she vowed that one day the same rank should be her’s.<br>In the time of Kassapa Buddha she was the fifth daughter of Kikī and her name was Dhammā. Then she entered the Order and lived a celibate life (Ap.ii.564f; ThigA.190f).

She saw from her balcony Siddhattha Gotama returning in his chariot to his palace on receipt of the news that a son had been born to him. Gotamī was gladdened by the sight of him, and gave vent to her exultation in the famous ”nibbutā-pada” (nibuttā nūna sā mātā, etc.).<br>Gotama was pleased by the mention of the word nibbuta, which to him meant deliverance, and as a mark of his gratitude sent her the necklace of pearls which he wore, worth one hundred thousand. She accepted it gladly as a token of his love (J.i.60f; BuA.232f). She is sometimes spoken of as a cousin of Gotama, his father’s brother’s daughter (pitucchādhītā). (E.g., DhA.i.70; DhSA.34.

'kitavāsa':['King of Benares. A son was born to him who was named Dutthakumāra, and who, according to the fortune-tellers, would die for lack of water. In order to falsify the prophecy, the king guarded his son closely, made numerous tanks near the city, and saw that vessels of water were placed wherever possible. One day, while returning from the park, the prince saw a Pacceka Buddha, and being angry that obeisance should be paid to the Buddha instead of to himself, he took the Buddha’s bowl and dashed it on the ground. The prince’s body burst into flames, but all the water around having dried up, they could not be quenched and he was swallowed up in hell. When Kitavāsa heard of this he was greatly grieved, but on reflection he realised that his grief sprang from affection, and thenceforth resolved to fix his love on nothing.<br>Kitavāsa is identified with Chattapāni of the Dhammaddhaja Jātaka, Chattapāni himself being a former birth of Sāriputta (J.ii.194ff).<br>The story of Kitavāsa’s son bears close resemblance to that of Kitava’s son (see Kundinagariya Thera).

On hearing of it, the Buddha sentSāriputta andMoggallāna to proclaim on them an act of banishment. (J.ii.387; Vin.ii.9f; iii.179f; DhA.ii.108f). Some time after, when the Buddha visited the place with a large company of monks, including Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the Assajipunabbasukā, were asked to provide lodgings for the visitors. They agreed to do so for the Buddha, but would have nothing to do with Sāriputta and Moggallāna (Vin.ii.171).<br>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.668), Kitāgiri was the name of a nigama (township).

The artisan who built it was blinded, in case he should build another like it (J.iii.157; but see DhA.iii.134f, where it is said that, warned by Bodhi’s friend, Sanjikāputta, the builder escaped on a magic bird).<br>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.739), the palace was called Kokanada (lotus), because it was built in the form of a hanging lotus.<br>2. Kokanada.-A lute (vinā) given by Sakka to Sīlavatī, Kusa’s mother, and afterwards used by Kusa to win back Pabhāvatī (J.v.281, 290).

Kokanuda asks Ananda a series of questions, such as whether the world is eternal, whether the Tathāgata lives after death, etc., all of which, Ananda says, are impossible to answer, not because he himself does not know these things, but because he does know them. Finally, Kokanuda asks Ananda who he is, and, on learning his identity, asks his pardon for his questions which he had asked in all ignorance. A.v.196f.'],
'kokālika jātaka':['King Brahmadatta was very talkative, and his minister, the Bodhisatta, sought an opportunity of admonishing him. This opportunity occurred while they were watching a crow’s nest in which a cuckoo had laid an egg. The crow watched over it and fed the young cuckoo after its birth. One day the cuckoo cried before it was grown up, and the crow killed it and threw it away. The king inquired of the Bodhisatta the reason for this, and he explained that the garrulous who talk in and out of season meet with a similar fate. The king was cured of his evil habit.<br>The story was told in reference to Kokālika, who is identified with the young cuckoo. J.iii.102f'],
'kokālika sutta':['1. Kokālika (Kokāliya) Sutta (See Kokālika 2).-The story of Kokālika - according to Buddhaghosa (SnA.ii.473), to be distinguished as Cūla Kokālika. It contains the verses preached by the Buddha to Kokālika. The verses describe the evil of back-biting and the terrors that await the back-biter after death. The Sutta Nipāta contains twenty-two verses (657-78). The Sutta Nipāta Commentary says (p.477f) that the last two stanzas are not explained in the Mahā Atthakathā, and that therefore they did not belong to the original sutta. Of the remaining twenty the last fourteen (663-76) are called by Buddhaghosa the Turitavatthugāthā, and he says that they were uttered by Moggallāna as Kokālika lay dying, by way of admonition, and that, according to others, Mahā Brahma was the speaker. The first three stanzas (658-60) are, in the Samyutta Nikāya (i.149), attributed to Tudu. In the Anguttara Nikāya (v.171-4; the verses are also found in A.ii.3 and in S.i.149ff; Netti.132), also, Tudu speaks them; but according to this version the Buddha repeats them.<br>2. Kokālika Sutta.-Gives the story of Kokālika (2) speaking ill of Sāriputta and Moggallāna before the Buddha, of Kokālika’s illness and death, of his admonition by Tudu, and of the announcement of his death and subsequent birth in the Paduma-niraya by Sahampatī to the Buddha. A monk questions the Buddha on the duration of suffering in the Paduma-niraya, and the Buddha proceeds to instruct him by means of various illustrations. The sutta ends with the repetition by the Buddha of Tudu’s verses. A.v.171-4; also S.i.149ff.<br>3. Kokālika Sutta.-Subrahmā visits the Buddha at Sāvatthi and utters verses in reference to Kokālika.

'kolambahālaka':['A village in Ceylon, where Bhalluka pitched his camp (Mhv.xxv.80; see also Mhv. Trs.176, n.2). It is probably identical with Kolambālaka (Mhv.xxxiii.42), in which case it was near the Titthārāma, in the neighbourhood of the northern gate of Anurādhapura. There was also a monastery called Kolambahalāka founded by Sūratissa, and said to have been near Raheraka (Mhv.xxi.5). The Kolambahālaka-parivena was the residence of the monk Dāthāvedhaka.

'kolitagāma':['The village in which Mahāmoggallāna was born.<br>It was near Upatissagāma and not far from Rājagaha. See, e.g., SNA.i.326; DhA.i.73; Mtu.iii.56.'],
'koliyā':['One of the republican clans in the time of the Buddha.<br>The Koliyā owned two chief settlements - one at Rāmagāma and the other at Devadaha. The Commentaries (DA.i.260f; SNA.i.356f; A.ii.558; ThagA.i.546; also Ap.i.94) contain accounts of the origin of the Koliyas. We are told that a king of Benares, named Rāma (the Mtu.i.353 calls him Kola and explains from this the name of the Koliyas), suffered from leprosy, and being detested by the women of the court, he left the kingdom to his eldest son and retired into the forest. There, living on woodland leaves and fruits, he soon recovered, and, while wandering about, came across Piyā, the eldest of the five daughters of Okkāka, she herself being afflicted with leprosy. Rāma, having cured her, married her, and they begot thirty-two sons. With the help of the king of Benares, they built a town in the forest, removing a big kola-tree in doing so. The city thereupon came to be called Kolanagara, and because the site was discovered on a tiger-track (vyagghapatha) it was also called Vyagghapajjā. The descendants of the king were known as Koliyā.<br>According to the Kunālā Jātaka (J.v.413), when the Sākyans wished to abuse the Koliyans, they said that the Koliyans had once ”lived like animals in a Kola-tree,” as their name signified. The territories of the Sākiyans and the Koliyans were adjacent, separated by the river Rohinī. The khattiyas of both tribes intermarried, and both claimed relationship with the Buddha. (It is said that once the Koliyan youths carried away many Sākiyan maidens while they were bathing, but the Sākiyans, regarding the Koliyans as relatives, took no action; DA.i.262). A quarrel once arose between the two tribes regarding the right to the waters of the Rohinī, which irrigated the land on both sides, and a bloody feud was averted only by the intervention of the Buddha. In gratitude, each tribe dedicated some of its young men to the membership of the Order, and during the Buddha’s stay in the neighbourhood, he lived alternately in Kapilavatthu and in Koliyanagara. (For details of this quarrel and its consequences see J.v.412ff; DA.ii.672ff; DhA.iii.254ff).<br>Attached probably to the Koliyan central authorities, was a special body of officials, presumably police, who wore a distinguishing headdress with a drooping crest (Lambacūlakābhatā). They bore a bad reputation for extortion and violence (S.iv.341).<br>Besides the places already mentioned, several other townships of the Koliyans, visited by the Buddha or by his disciples, are mentioned in literature - e.g.,<br>Uttara, the residence of the headman Pātaliya (S.iv.340); Sajjanela, residence of Suppavāsā (A.ii.62); Sāpūga, where Ananda once stayed (A.ii.194); Kakkarapatta, where lived Dīghajānu (A.iv.281); and Haliddavasana, residence of the ascetics Punna Koliyaputta and Seniya (M.i.387; see also S.v.115). Nisabha (ThagA.i.318), Kakudha (SA.i.89) (attendant of Moggallāna), and Kankhā-Revata (Ap.ii.491) (and perhaps Sona Kolivisa, q.v.), were also Koliyans.<br>After the Buddha’s death the Koliyans of Rāmagāma claimed and obtained one-eighth of the Buddha’s relics, over which they erected a thūpa (D.ii.167; Mhv.xxi.18, 22ff). See also s.v. Suppavāsā.'],
'komāyaputta jātaka':['Some ascetics in Himavā failed to take their duties seriously and spent their time in eating and making merry. They had a monkey who provided them with amusement. One day when the ascetics went to the plains for salt and condiments, the Bodhisatta, who had been born as a brahmin ascetic named Komāyaputta, occupied their lodging; when the monkey started to play his pranks for him, the Bodhisatta snapped his fingers at him and told him to behave properly, because he lived with ascetics. The monkey thereupon became virtuous and refused to return to his evil ways, even after the arrival of his former friends.<br>The story was told at the Pubbārāma, in reference to some monks who lived there in the apartments below those of the Buddha, and who were quarrelsome and abusive.

Konāgamana left the world on an elephant and practised austerities only for six months, at the end of which time he was given milk-rice by the daughter of the brahmin Aggisoma and grass for his seat by the yavapālaka Tinduka. His Bodhi was an Udumbara tree. His first sermon was preached in the Migadāya near Sudassana-nagara, at the foot of a Mahā-sāla tree. He held only one assembly of his disciples, who numbered thirty thousand. His body was thirty cubits in height.<br>He died in the Pabbatārāma at the age of thirty thousand. His relics were scattered. His chief disciples were Bhīyya and Uttara among monks, and Samuddā and Uttarā among nuns, his constant attendant being Sotthiya. His chief patrons were Ugga and Somadeva among laymen, and Sīvalā and Sāmā among laywomen. The Bodhisatta was a khattiya named Pabbata of Mithilā. He held an almsgiving, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order. (D.i.7; Bu.xxiv; BuA.213ff; J.i.42f; according to the Jātaka his body was twenty cubits high; Sp.i.190).<br>The banker Ugga built for the Buddha a Sanghārāma half a league in extent (J.i.94).<br>On the day of the Buddha’s birth a shower of gold fell all over Jambudīpa, hence he was called Kanakāgamana, Konāgamana being a corrupt form of that word (BuA.213-14)<br>According to the Ceylon Chronicles (Dpv.ii.67; xv.25, 44, 48; xvii.9, 17, 73; Mhv.xv.91-124), Konāgamana visited their Island (then known as Varadīpa), with thirty thousand disciples, accepted the Mahānoma garden at Vaddhamāna, given by King Samiddha, and preached the doctrine. At the conclusion of his sermon, thirty thousand people realised the Truth. At the Buddha’s wish, the nun Kantakānandā (v.l. Kanakadattā) brought to Ceylon a branch of the Bodhi-tree. The Buddha also preached at the Ratanamāla, the Sudassanamāla and the Nāgamālaka and gave his girdle for the people’s worship. He left Mahāsumba and Kantakānandā to look after the new converts.<br>In Konāgamana’s time Mount Vepulla was known as Vankaka, and the people living on the mountain were called Rohitassā, their term of life being thirty thousand years (S.ii.191).

(Vin.iv.8; but it is also Sakka’s gotta, and is therefore generally regarded as a high one; see e.g., Thag.415; ThagA.i.452).<br>Among those mentioned as belonging to this gotta are the brahminKevatta (J.vi.418f), the brahmin who was the father of Sona Kumāra (the Bodhisatta) (J.v.319ff), Bhaddākāpilāni, born in Sāgala (AA.i.99; ThagA.68; SA ii.144), and the banker who came to be known asMacchari-Kosiya.<br>Kātiyāna’s father was a Kosiyan, but he married a woman of the Kātiyāna family (ThagA.i.452).<br>The Bhūridatta Jātaka (J.vi.181; Mtu.ii.49) mentions a sage Kosiya, who taught Alambāyana the Nāga-spell. The scholiast says he belonged to the Kosiyagotta.<br>The Sālikedāra Jātaka (J.iv.278f) mentions a brahmin of Sālindiya, called Kosiyagotta, probably for the same reason.<br>The Kosiya Jātaka (J.i.465f) speaks of a Kosiya-brāhmanī. All these are either addressed or spoken of as Kosiya in their different contexts. The name Kosiya is also used twice in speaking of Sakka - once by the Buddha (D.ii.270), once by Mahā Moggallāna (M.i.252) - and again by Guttila (J.ii.252) and by Mahā Kassapa (Ud.iii.7; UdA.200; DhA.i.429).<br>The name means ”belonging to the Kusika family.” It is once used of Indra in the Rg Veda, in what exact sense is not known. Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.ii.296f; see also Dvy.632; Mtu.iii.200, 202, 315, 403) that perhaps we have here a survival from the time when Indra was only the god of a Kusika clan.<br>The word Kosiya (e.g., J.ii.208) means ”Owl” and is probably one of the several clan names which are also names of animals (cf. Vaccha).<br>2. Kosiya.-See Macchari-Kosiya.<br>3. Kosiya Thera.-An arahant. He belonged to a brahmin family in Magadha and was called by his gotta-name. He often listened to the preaching of Sāriputta and, joining the Order, in due course won arahant ship. He was a gate-keeper of Bandhumatī and in the time of Vipassī Buddha gave to the Buddha a piece of sugar-cane. (Thag.370-4; ThagA.i.431f).<br>He is probably identical with Ucchukandika of theApadāna.

When the latter discovered the truth, he advised the brahmin to prepare a mess of cow-dung and other things and to insist that his wife should either swallow this medicine or get up and work. She then knew that her shamming was discovered and abandoned her evil ways.<br>The story was told to a brahmin of Sāvatthi, a pious follower of the Buddha, whose wife behaved in a similar way. The Buddha told him this story of the past and asked him to try the same remedy, for, he said, the brahmin and his wife were identical with the couple of the story (J.i.463f).<br>In the atītavatthu the woman is addressed as ”Kosiyā.” The scholiast (J.i.465) adds that she belonged to the Kosiyagotta.<br>2.

It may have been so called in reference to the fact that Anāthapindika bought the land by spreading on it a crore of kahāpaṇas (kahāpaṇa-koti-santhārena) (J.i.94). Or the name may have been restricted to the part actually covered by the pieces of money, for we are told (Vin.ii.159) that the money was not sufficient to cover the whole of the ground.<br>There were buildings in the Kotisanthāra, the monks living in these buildings being referred to as ”Antokotisanthāre vasantā.” (E.g., J.iv.113)<br>Kotisanthāra is generally translated as The Golden Pavement, (E.g., Jāt.

Buddhaghosa mentions (MA.ii.571; AA.ii.866) that the Kukkutarāma was made by Kukkuta Setthi, but gives no further particulars. Here there is probably some confusion with the ārāma of the same name at Kosambī. Hiouen Thsang (Beal: op. cit.ii, 95) says that the Kukkutārāma was to the southeast of the old city of Pātaliputta and was built by Asoka when he first became a convert to the Buddha’s religion. ”It was a sort of first-fruit and a pattern of majestic construction.” Only the foundation of the building was left at the time of Hiouen Thsang’s visit. It is probable that this account refers to the Asokārāma whichAsoka built as the first of his Buddhist structures, and that the Asokārāma was constructed on the site of the old Kukkutārāma. It is significant that the Pāli books, in recording Asoka’s doings, make no mention of a Kukkutārāma existing in his time, though the Sanskrit texts, the Divyāvadāna (E.g., pp.381f, 430ff; see also Smith: Asoka, 183, 193f), for instance, makes frequent reference to it. If the conjecture made above, namely that the Asokārāma replaced the Kukkutārāma, be correct, it may have been that the place was known by both names in Asoka’s time.<br>3.

'kulāvaka jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was born in Macala under the name of Magha. He spent his time with the heads of the other twenty-nine families in the village, engaged in various forms of social service. The headman, finding his gains diminish, made a false report to the king, who ordered Magha and his friends to be trampled by elephants; but by virtue of their mettā they could not be killed, and thereupon the king showed them great favour. After death they were all born in Tāvatimsa, with Magha as Sakka.<br>Three of Magha’s wives - Sudhammā, Cittā and Nandā - who had persuaded him to let them share in his good work, were born as Sakka’s handmaidens. But Sujātā, who had taken no part in their activities, received no such honour. At that time the Asuras shared Tāvatimsa with the Devas, but one day they got drunk and were hurled down to the foot of Sineru. They therefore declared war on the Devas, and during one of their fierce battles Sakka was defeated and fled over the sea in his chariot Vejayanta. When he came to Simbalivana, the chariot felled down the trees there, and the young Garulas were hurled into the sea. Hearing their cries of agony, Sakka made his driver, Mātali, turn the chariot and go back. The Asuras, seeing him return, thought it was another Sakka coming with reinforcements, and fled in terror. The Vejayanta-pāsāda rose from the earth, and Sakka lived in it, having fortified his city with a fivefold guard.<br>The story was told in reference to a monk who had drunk water without first straining it, because his friend, with whom he was travelling and with whom he had fallen out, had the only strainer available. Mātali is identified with Ananda (J.i.198ff; with the introductory story cp. Vin.ii.118).<br>In the version given in the Dhammapada Commentary (i.263ff; see also SA.i.260f; DA.iii.710ff; and SNA.ii.484f; according to these accounts Sakka was helped by not 29 but 33 others), the story of Magha is related in response to a question asked of the Buddha by the Licchavi Mahāli. The reason given for Sakka’s flight in the Vejayantaratha also differs. According to this account, when Sujātā (q.v.) was reborn as the daughter of Vepacitti and the time came for her to choose a husband, Sakka went to the assembly in the guise of an aged Asura and was chosen by Sujātā. Sakka thereupon revealed himself and fled with his bride in the chariot, the Asuras in full chase.<br>See also Kulāvaka Sutta.'],

'kumā':['Wife of a householder in Velukanda in theAvanti country.<br>She was the mother of Nanda Thera, also called Kumāputta.<br>ThagA.1.100.'],
'kumāra':['1. Kumāra-Kassapa Thera.-He was foremost among those who had the gift of varied and versatile discourse (cittakathikānam) (A.i.24). His mother was the daughter of a banker of Rājagaha, and she, having failed to obtain her parent’s consent to become a nun, married and, with her husband’s consent, joined the Order, not knowing that she was with child. When her condition was discovered her colleagues consultedDevadatta, who declared that she was no true nun. The Buddha, on being consulted, entrusted the matter to Upāli, who had it fully investigated byVisākhā and other residents ofSāvatthi, and he gave his finding in the assembly, in the presence of the king, that the nun was innocent. (For details see J.i.148; Upāli’s handling of the case won the Buddha’s special commendation, see, e.g., AA.i.172). When the boy was born the king reared him, and the boy was ordained at the age of seven. The boy came to be called Kumāra, because he joined the Order so young and was of royal upbringing, and also because the Buddha, when sending him little delicacies such as fruit, referred to him as Kumāra Kassapa.<br>Once when Kumāra Kassapa was meditating in Andhavana, an anāgāmī Brahmā, who had been his companion in the time of Kassapa Buddha, appeared before him, and asked him fifteen questions which only the Buddha could answer. This led to the preaching of theVammika Sutta (M.i.143ff), and after dwelling on its teachings Kassapa became an arahant. (For Kumāra Kassapa’s story see J.i.147ff; AA.i.158f; ThagA.i.322f; MA.i.335f).<br>His mother, too, developed insight and attained to arahantship. It is said that she wept for twelve years because she could not be with Kassapa, and one day, seeing him in the street, as she ran towards him and fell, milk flowed from her breasts and wet her robe. Kassapa, realising that her great love was standing in the way of her attainments, spoke harshly to her that she might love him the less. The ruse succeeded and she became an arahant that very day (DhA.iii.147).<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Kassapa was a learned brahmin, and having heard a monk ranked foremost in eloquence, he wished for a similar distinction and did many acts of piety towards that end. When the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were being forgotten, he, together with six others, entered the Order and lived a life of rigorous asceticism on the summit of a mountain. (Ap.ii.473f; the details of this story are given in DhA.ii.210-12; among Kassapa’s companions were also Pukkusāti,Dārucīriya,Dabba Mallaputta andSabhiya; see also UdA.80f).<br>Two verses of deep significance ascribed to Kumāra-Kassapa are found in the Theragāthā (vv.201.202). Although it is said that he was a very eloquent speaker, the examples given of his preaching are extremely scanty. The Anguttara Commentary (i.159) states that the Buddha gave him his title from the skilful way in which he argued with Pāyāsi, as related in the Pāyāsi Sutta; but this cannot be correct for, according toDhammapāla (VvA.297), the events of the Pāyāsi Sutta took place after the Buddha’s death. The Sutta, however, does justify Kassapa’s reputation. (For his praises see also MA.i.500f).<br>Kassapa’s upasampadā took place in his twentieth year. A doubt arose as to whether this was valid because, according to the rule, twenty years must be completed for upasampadā. The Buddha held that in reckoning the age the time spent in the mother’s womb could also be included. Vin.i.93; Sp.iv.867.<br>2.

Thus he was<br>Ajjuna, one of Kanha’s husbands; the goldsmith in the story of Saccatapāvī; the Garuda in Kākātī’s tale; Chalaṅgakumāra, who misconducted himself with Kuraṅgavī; Pañcālacanda, lover of Brahmadatta’s mother; the chaplain, also called Pañcālacanda, who saved Kinnarā from her husband’s wrath; Baka, one time husband of Pañcapāpā; and Brahmadatta, husband of Pingiyānī.Punnamukha is identified with Udāyī, the vulture-king with Ananda and Nārada with Sāriputta.<br>The preaching of the Kunāla Jātaka was followed by that of the Mahāsamaya Sutta.<br>This Jātaka was related in order to destroy the discontent that rose in the hearts of the Sākiyan youths, kinsmen of the Buddha, who, having entered the Order, were troubled by the thought of the wives they had left behind. The Buddha therefore took them to the Himalaya, showed them the magnificent beauty of the region, particularly the miraculous splendours of the Kunāladaha, and there preached to them. At the end of the Jātaka they all became arahants. We are told that that very day they became arahants (J.v.412-56; also DA.ii.674ff; AA.i.173).<br>See also the Cūla Kunāla Jātaka.'],
'kuṇālā':['The name of a river (mahānadī) which flows out of the Kunāladaha. It dries up when, at the end of the kappa, the fourth sun rises. A.iv.101.'],
'kundadhāna thera':['An arahant. He was proclaimed the first among those who received food tickets (salāka) (A.i.24). He came of a brahmin family of Sāvatthi and his name was Dhāna. He knew the Vedas by heart, and when advanced in years, heard the Buddha preach and joined the Order. From that day, however, in all his movements the form of a young woman followed him wherever he went, though he himself could not see the figure. This caused great merriment and evoked many sarcastic remarks, which he could not understand. When he went for alms women would put into his bowl two portions of food, saying, ”One is for your Reverence and the other for your friend, the young lady, your companion.” In the monastery the novices and young monks would point at him and say: ”Look, our venerable one has become a konda” (gallant?). From this he became known as Konda- or Kundadhāna. Driven to distraction by this teasing, he became abusive and was reported to the Buddha, who hade him be patient as he was only being pursued by the remnant of an evil kamma. Pasenadi, king of Kosala, hearing of Kundadhāna, was interested, and being satisfied by personal investigation that the Elder was blameless, provided him with all necessaries, so that he need no longer go round for alms. This enabled him to concentrate his mind, and he became an arahant. Thereupon the figure of the woman disappeared.<br>Kundadhāna’s claim to be the first among receivers of salāka was due to the fact that he it was who received the first food-ticket when the Buddha visited<br>Mahā-Subhaddā at Ugganagara, Culla-Subhaddā at Sāketa, and also the Sunāparanta-janapada. Only khīnāsavas were allowed to accompany the Buddha on these visits.<br>Kundadhāna’s determination to attain this special eminence was formed in the time of Padumuttara Buddha. Once he gave Padumuttara a well-ripened ”comb” of bananas when the Buddha arose from a long trance. As a result he became king of the devas eleven times and king of men twenty-four times.<br>He was an earthbound sprite in the time of Kassapa Buddha. Seeing two monks, firm friends, on their way to the uposatha held by the Buddha, he had a mischievous desire to test their friendship, and when one of the monks retired into the forest leaving the other on the road, he followed the former, unseen by him, assuming the form of a woman arranging her hair, adjusting her garments, and so on. The second monk, seeing his friend return and shocked by his apparent misdemeanour, left him in disgust, refusing to perform the uposatha with him. Realising the effect of his practical joke, the sprite did all he could to make amends, but the friendship of the two monks was for ever spoilt. The sprite suffered the fears of hell for a whole Buddha-era, and even in his last birth as Kundadhāna his evil kamma pursued him, as seen above. AA.i.146ff; Thag.A.i.62ff; also Ap.i.81f; Thag.15. The version given in Dh A.iii.52f differs very slightly in certain details.<br>Kundadhāna was among those to whom the Buddha preached theNalakapāna Sutta, and was therefore probably a friend of Anuruddha and the other Sākiyan nobles present on that occasion (M.i.462). v.l. Konda-dhāna, Konthadhāna, Kuddadhāna.'],
'kuṇḍadhānavana':['A forest near the Koliyan village of Kundiya. (DhA.iv.192 calls it Kundikoliya, v.l. Kundikeliya).<br>It was once the residence of the Yakkha Kunda, who favoured offerings made to him with kunda-dhāna (vessels containing rice-powder?). A woman, who was the head of a village (gāmapatikā), formed a settlement on a spot indicated by the Yakkha and was guarded by him. She thus came to be known as Kundiyā, and when, later, the Koliyan nobles built a city on the same spot, the city was known as Kundiya. In the forest tract the Koliyan nobles built a monastery for the Buddha and his monks. It was while the Buddha was dwelling in this monastery that Suppavāsā gave birth to Sīvalī, after prolonged labour pains, which only ceased after she received the Buddha’s blessing (Ud.ii.8; UdA.122; DhA.iv.192f; J.i.407).<br>v.l. Kunditthāna, Kundikāna, Kunhāna.'],
'kundakakucchisindhava jātaka':['A householder was lodging in a poor old woman’s house on the road from Benares to Uttarāpatha. During his stay there his thoroughbred mare foaled, and the foal was given to the woman at her request, in part payment of her charges. She brought up the foal as though he were her own child. Some time after, the Bodhisatta, who was then a householder, happened to pass the same way and discovered the thoroughbred’s presence by the behaviour of his own horses. The woman agreed to part with the foal to him for a large price on condition that he should be provided with all manner of luxuries. The Bodhisatta kept his word, and when the king came to inspect his horses, made the foal, who knew his own worth, exhibit his marvellous powers. The king installed him as his state horse, and thereafter the lordship of all India passed into the king’s hands.<br>The story was told in reference to Sāriputta. Once, when the Buddha was returning to Sāvatthi after a tour, the citizens decided to celebrate his arrival by each one taking on himself the task of feeding a certain number of monks in the Buddha’s retinue. A poor old woman wished to feed a monk, but all the monks were already allotted, only Sāriputta remaining. She invited him to her house, and he accepted her invitation. When it became known that Sāriputta was to feed with her, the king and all the rich citizens of Sāvatthi sent her food and garments and money to help in her entertainment of the Elder. As a result, through the kindness of Sāriputta, she became rich in a single day.<br>Sāriputta is identified with the thoroughbred of the Jātaka (J.ii.286ff).<br>This is evidently the same story as that which, in the Dhammapada Commentary (iii.325), is called the Kundakasindhayapotaka Jātaka. But there the story is related, not in reference to Sāriputta, but to the Buddha himself, because he accepted a cake of rice-husks from the slave-woman Punnā. This is probably due to some confusion with two or more stories of similar import. See alsoKundakapūva Jātaka.'],
'kundakapūva jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once a tree-sprite in a castor-oil tree and received worship and offerings from many people. Among them was a very poor man who, having nothing else to offer at the tree, took a cake made of husk powder. But when he saw the other rich offerings, he felt that the sprite would never accept so humble a gift and wished to eat the cake himself. The tree-sprite appeared, took the offering, and revealed to the man that heaps of treasure lay buried under the tree. The man informed the king of this, and the king, in return, appointed him royal treasurer.<br>The story was told in reference to a poor man of Sāvatthi. Once the people of a whole street in that town pooled their resources in order to entertain the Buddha and his monks to a meal of rice-gruel and cakes. The poor man, unable to afford anything else, made a bran-cake and by sheer determination put it in the alms-bowl of the Buddha himself. When it became known that the Buddha had accepted it, people of all classes crowded round the man offering him wealth if he would share with them the merit he had gained. After consulting with the Buddha, the man accepted the offers, and the gifts he received amounted to nine crores. That same evening the king appointed him treasurer. J.i.422f.'],
'kuṇḍala':['An arahant. He came of a brahmin family of Sāvatthi and entered the Order, but from want of mental balance he could not concentrate his thoughts. Then, one day, while begging for alms, he saw how men conducted water whither they wished by digging channels, how the fletcher fixed the arrow shaft in his lathe surveying it from the corner of his eye, how the chariot-makers planed axle and tire and hub. Dwelling on these things, he soon attained arahantship.<br>In the past he was a park-keeper, and gave a coconut to the Buddha Vipassī, which the Buddha accepted while travelling through the air (ThagA.i.71f).<br>Perhaps he is to be identified with Nālikeradāyaka Thera of the Apadāna (ii.447f). The same Apadāna-verses, however, are also ascribed to Khitaka Thera (ThagA.i.315f).<br>The verse attributed to Kundala in the Theragāthā (Thag.19) occurs twice in the Dhammapada, and is in the Dhammapada Commentary mentioned as having been preached once in reference to Pandita-Sāmanera (DhA.ii.147), and once in reference to Sukha-Sāmanera (DhA.iii.99).'],

'kuru':['A country, one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas (D.ii.200; A.i.213 etc.). Frequent references to it are found in the Pāli Canon. It is said that Kuru was originally the name of the chieftains (rājakumārā) of the country and that their territory was later named after them. Buddhaghosa records a tradition (DA.ii.481f; MA.i.184 etc.) which states that, when Mandhātā returned to Jambudīpa from his sojourn in the four Mahādīpas and in the devalokas, there were in his retinue a large number of the people of Uttarakuru. They settled down in Jambudīpa, and their settlement was known as Kururattha. It had many towns and villages.<br>The country seems to have had very little political influence in the Buddha’s time, though, in the past, Pañcāla, Kuru and Kekaka were evidently three of the most powerful kingdoms (See, e.g., J.ii.214). According to the Jātakas (E.g., J.v.57, 484; vi.255. Also Mtu.i.34; ii.419), the kingdom of Kuru was three hundred leagues in extent and its capital, Indapatta, seven leagues in circumference. The ruling dynasty at Indapatta belonged to the Yudhitthila-gotta (J.iii.400; iv.361).<br>Among the kings of the past, Dhanañjaya Koravya is mentioned several times (J.ii.366; iii.400; iv.450; vi.260 etc.) and reference is also made to a king called Koravya (J.iv.361; v.457) whose son was the BodhisattaSutasoma. During the Buddha’s time, also, the chieftain of Kuru was called Koravya, and his discussion with the Elder Ratthapāla, who was himself the scion of a noble family of the Kurus, is recounted in the Ratthapāla Sutta (M.ii.65ff). Perhaps at one time the Kuru kingdom extended as far as Uttarapañcāla, for in the Somanassa Jātaka (J.iv.444), Uttarapañcāla is mentioned as a town in the Kururattha, with Renu as its king.<br>Koravya had a park called Migācīra where Ratthapāla took up his residence when he visited his parents (MA.ii.725).<br>The people of Kuru had a reputation for deep wisdom and good health, and this reputation is mentioned (MA.i.184f; AA.ii.820; they were also probably reputed to be virtuous; see the Kurudhamma Jātaka) as the reason for the Buddha having delivered some of his most profound discourses to the Kurus, for example, the Mahānidāna, and the Mahāsatipatthāna Suttas. Among other discourses delivered in the Kuru country are the Māgandiya Sutta, the Anañjasappāya Sutta, the Sammosa Sutta and the Ariyavasā Sutta. All these were preached at Kammāssadhamma, which is described as a nigama of the Kurūs, where the Buddha resided from time to time.<br>Another town of the Kurūs, which we find mentioned, is Thullakotthika, the birthplace of Ratthapāla, and here the Buddha stayed during a tour (M.ii.54; ThagA.ii.30). Udena’s queen, Māgandiyā, came from Kuru (DhA.i.199), and Aggidatta, chaplain to the Kosala king, lived on the boundary between Kuru and Ariga and Magadha, honoured by the inhabitants of all three kingdoms (DhA.iii.242).<br>The Kuru country is generally identified as the district around Thānesar, with its capital Indapatta, near the modern Delhi (CAGI.379f).<br>See also Uttarakuru.'],
'kurudhamma jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once born as the son of Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurūs, and, after his father’s death, reigned in Indapatta. He observed the Kurudhamma - that is to say, the pañcasīla - as did the queen-mother, his queen-consort, the viceroy, the chaplain, the king’s driver, his charioteer, the treasurer, the keeper of the royal granaries, the palace porter and the courtesan of the city. The country thus became very prosperous and its people happy. In the kingdom of Kalinga there was a drought and consequent scarcity of food. The king, acting on the advice of his ministers, sent brahmins to beg from the Bodhisatta the loan of his state elephant, Añjanavasabha, who was reported to bring rain. The elephant was lent willingly but no rain fell. It was thereupon decided that the prosperity of the Kurus was due to the Kurudhamma observed by the king and the others, and messengers were despatched to find out which these Kurudhammas were. From the king down to the courtesan, all had rigorously kept them, but each had unwittingly done something which he or she considered a violation of the dhamma. The messengers, therefore, had to visit each one and take down a list of the dhamma. The incidents related by each to the messengers, explaining wherein they had transgressed the dhammas, only served to emphasise how scrupulously they had conducted themselves.<br>The Kalinga king practised the Kurudhamma and rain fell in his country.<br>The story was told in reference to a monk who had killed a wild goose. Two monks bathed in Aciravatī, and while standing on the bank, drying, they saw two geese appear. The monks took a bet as to which should hit the goose in the eye, and one of them threw a stone which pierced one eye and came out of the other. The monk was reported to the Buddha.

The antelope escaped, but the tortoise, exhausted by his labours, was caught by the huntsman. The antelope thereupon enticed the hunter into the forest and, eluding him, released the tortoise.

'kusa':['The Bodhisatta, son of Okkāka, king ofKusāvatī and of his queen Sīlavatī. Okkāka has no heir, in spite of performing various rites. But at length, by the favour of Sakka, Sīlavatī miraculously gives birth to two sons. The elder, though ill-favoured, is supernaturally wise and is called Kusa. The younger, very handsome, is called Jayampati. Kusa consents to marry only on condition that a princess can be obtained exactly like an image which he himself has fashioned. Pabhāvatī, daughter of King Madda of Sāgala, is found to fulfil this condition, and is married to Kusa. The bride is not to look upon her husband’s face until she has conceived, but Kusa plays various pranks upon her and she accidentally discovers how ugly he is. She leaves him immediately and returns to her father’s court. Thither Kusa follows her, and under a variety of menial disguises, including that of a cook, tries, but in vain, to win her affection. At length Sakka intervenes. He sends letters, purporting to come from King Madda, to seven kings, offering Pabhāvatī to each of them. They arrive in Sāgala simultaneously and threaten to destroy the city. Madda decides to cut Pabhāvatī into seven pieces, and she is only saved from immediate death by the despised husband. At his appearance the kings flee, for wherever he looks the earth trembles. Kusa returns with his wife to Kusāvatī and they live there happily.<br>Pleased at Kusa’s victory, Sakka gives him a jewel called the Verocanamani. It was octagoṇal, and was evidently handed down in the succession of kings, for we are told that one of the tests, set by Videha, king of Mithilā, to discover the proficiency of Mahosadha, was for him to break the old thread in this gem, remove it, and insert a new one.

One day, in exasperation, the good novice heated water for the Elder’s bath and then hid it in a back room, leaving only a little in the boiler. When the other novice saw the steam rising he informed the Elder that his bath was ready. When asked where was the water, he let a ladle down into the almost empty boiler and the ladle rattled.

When the rains were over, the others, having won arahantship, returned and reported their various attainments to the Buddha. Kutumbiyaputta heard the Buddha praise them, and made up his mind to follow their example and so to go back with them the next day to the forest. That same night, however, filled with a yearning not to delay in beginning his austerities, he slept in an upright posture; but in the middle of the night he fell down and broke his thighbone. This accident delayed the departure of the other monks, and the Buddha, hearing of it, blamed Tissa for his unseasonable zeal and related the Varana Jātaka, showing how, in the past too, he had behaved similarly (J.i.316f).<br>The Commentaries lead us to believe (E.g., SA.ii.216; AA.i.29; see also Padhānakammika-Tissa) that Kutumbiyaputta did ultimately attain arahantship, for he is mentioned several times with Pitimalla and others as an example of one who put forth great exertion while suffering severe pain, in order to win his goal.<br>2.

He was, nevertheless, beautiful in body, says the ApA.; but see below.<br>Having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and became learned and eloquent, teaching others in a sweet voice. Once, on a festival day, a woman of the town, driving with a brahmin in a chariot, saw the Elder and laughed, showing her teeth. The Elder, taking the teeth as his object, developed jhāna and became an anāgāmī. Later, after being admonished bySāriputta, he developed mindfulness regarding the body and became an arahant. The Udāna (vii.1, 2) makes reference to the admonitions of Sāriputta and to the Buddha’s joy when these had the desired effect. The Commentary (UdA.360f.) gives details.<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a very rich householder of Hamsavatī, and, having beard the Buddha describe one of his monks as the sweetest voiced among them all, he wished for a similar distinction for himself under a future Buddha. In the time of Phussa Buddha he was a cittapattakokila, named Nanda, (the Ap.loc.infra says he was the king’s general) who, seeing the Buddha in the royal park, placed in his bowl a ripe mango. In Kassapa Buddhas day he was the chief architect entrusted with the building of the thūpa over the Buddha’s relics, and, when a dispute arose as to how big the thūpa should be, he decided in favour of a small one; hence his small stature in his last life. ThagA.i.469ff.; Ap.ii.489f; the account in AA.i.110f. is slightly different; theKelisīla Jātaka (q.v.) gives a different reason for his shortness.<br>In the assembly of monks the Buddha ranked him as foremost among sweet voiced monks (A.i.25) (mañjussarānam). Several stories connected with Bhaddiya are recorded in the books. Because of his shortness and his youthful appearance he was sometimes mistaken for a novice (DhA.iii.387). Elsewhere (S.ii.279; cp. Ud.vii.5) it is said that, because he was ugly and hunch backed, he was despised by his companions, and the Buddha had to proclaim to them his greatness and hold him up as an example of a man who, though small, was of great power. Another account relates how novices used to pull his hair and tweak his ears and nose saying, ”Uncle, you tire not of religion? You take delight in it?” But he showed no resentment and took no offence. DhA.ii.148; the introduction to the Kelisīla Jātaka, (J.ii.142) speaks of thirty monks from the country who, seeing Bhaddiya at Jetavana, pulled him about until they were told by the Buddha who he was.<br>It was in reference to Bhaddiya that the Buddha preached two famous riddle stanzas in the Dhammapada (294, 295; for the explanation of the riddle see DhA.iii.454), where he describes the arahant as one who has killed father and mother and two kings and destroyed a kingdom, but who yet goes scathe less - the words having a metaphorical meaning.<br>Several stanzas uttered by Bhaddiya in the Ambātakavana, as he sat there enjoying the bliss of arahantship, are included in the Theragāthā (Thag.vss.466 72).<br>In the Avadānasataka he is called Lakuñcika.

As a punishment, he ordered them to work at the remaking of a road along the bank of the tank, leading to the Mahā Thūpa, and set candalas to supervise them. Full of anger, the Lambakannas rose in revolt and seized the throne. Three years later the king returned from exile, and, having defeated the Lambakannas, made them drag his chariot in triumphal procession. When he proposed to behead them his mother intervened, and he contented himself with having their noses and toes cut off (Mhv.xxxv.18ff).<br>The Lambakannas were evidently a powerful clan, and several members of the clan ruled as kings of Ceylon - e.g., Vasabha, Sanghatissa, Sanghabodhi and Gothābhaya, the last three of whom came from Mahiyaṅgana and seized the throne from Vijayakumāra (Mhv.xxxvi.58ff). Between the reign of Kittisirimegha and the Coliyan conquest in 1017 A.C. i.e., between the third and the eleventh centuries out of thirty six kings who occupied the throne of Ceylon the majority belonged to either the Moriyā or the Lambakannā. A clan of Lambakannas lived also in South India in the twelfth century. When Lankāpura, acting under the orders of Parakkamabāhu I., crowned Vīrapaṇḍu as king of Pandu, three Lambakanna chiefs were asked to carry out ”the duties of the Lambakannas” (Lambakannadhuram) (Cv.lxxvii.27f).<br>The name may have had a totemistic origin, but according to some Singhalese Chronicles (E.g., the Saddharmaratnākara and the Pārakumbā-Sirita) the Lambakannas of Ceylon were a branch of the Moriyas. They claimed descent from Sumitta - a prince of the Moriyan clan, who formed one of the escort that brought the Bodhi-tree from India - and Sumanā, a princess of the same race, who was at one time a nun, ordained under Sanghamīttā. According to these Chronicles most of the kings of Ceylon down to the time of Parakkamabāhu VI. were scions of this clan.<br>In Ceylon, the Lambakannas had settlements in Rohana. See, e.g., AA.i.262.'],
'laṅkā':['Pāli names for Ceylon, found in the Chronicles - e.g., Dipavamsa, Mahāvamsa and the Commentaries.<br>An ancient tradition recorded in the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xv. 57ff), and in the Samantapāsādikā (Sp.i.86ff), gives the names of the Island in the times of the three previous Buddhas, the names of the capital cities, the different names of Mahāmeghavana, and of the kings contemporary with these Buddhas.<br>Thus, in the time of Kakusandha, the Island was called Ojadīpa, the king was Abhaya, the capital Abhayapura and Mahāmeghavana, Mahātittha. In the time of Konāgamana, the Island was Varadīpa, the capital Vaddhamāna, the king Samiddha and the park Mahānoma. In the time of Kassapa, the Island was Mandadīpa, the king Jayanta, the capital Visālā and the park Mahāsāgara. Besides Mahāmeghavana, the other physical feature of Ceylon, mentioned in these accounts, is the mountain known in the present age as Sumanakūta, whereon the Buddha Gotama placed his footprint. During the ages of the three previous Buddhas, it was known, respectively, as Devakūta, Sumanakūtaka and Subhakūta. Gotama paid three visits to Ceylon, while the other three Buddhas came only once. During their visits they consecrated various spots by spending there a short time wrapt in meditation.<br>Lankā was once inhabited by Yakkhas. Gotama Buddha obliged them to leave the Island and seek shelter in the neighboring Giridīpa. Lankādīpa was later colonized by Vijaya and his three hundred companions. Two cities of the Yakkhas are mentioned: Sirīsavatthu and Lankāpura.'],

It was during this visit that Bimbisāra giftedVeluvana to the Buddha and his Order (Vin.i.35ff.; DhA.i.88; AA.i.166; BuA.18, etc.). Eleven nahutas, with Bimbisāra at their head, became sotāpannas at the end of the Buddha’s sermon, which included the Mahānārada Kassapa Jātaka. The remaining nahuta was established in the Refuges (J.i.84; AA.i.57; also J.vi.219).<br>The grove evidently received its name from its green liquorice creepers, hence its description as Latthimadhukavana (E.g., J.i.68).<br>Hiouen Thsang calls it Yastivana and describes it as a grove of bamboos, giving accounts of its origin and various stories connected with it.

But a rogue elephant, who came after, though warned in the same way, trod on the nest and fouled it. The quail swore revenge, and got a crow to put out the elephant’s eyes and a fly to put maggots in them, and when the elephant, in great pain, looked for water, she persuaded a frog to croak on the mountain top and thus to lead the elephant into a precipice down which he fell and was killed.<br>The story was told in reference to Devadatta who was identified with the rogue elephant (J.iii.174 77). In the accounts (see Rohinī ) of the quarrel between the Sākyans and the Koliyans, this Jātaka is said to have been one of those preached by the Buddha on that occasion, showing that even such a weak animal as a quail could sometimes cause the death of an elephant. Perhaps the story was related on more than one occasion. See also below, Latukikopama sutta.<br>See DhA.i.46, where it is related to the Kosambī monks to show the danger of quarrelling.'],

The Buddha agrees, but adds that many people are foolish, and consider such sacrifices insignificant, growing discontented when asked to make them. But this insignificant thing develops into a bond strong enough to hold them fast. Some people are like quails caught in traps, unable to escape from their bonds, others like mighty elephants, bursting their bonds and going where they wish. Thus there are four types of individuals, differing according as to whether they are attached to their bonds or detached from them.<br>M.i.447-56; MA.ii.656-60.'],

Sakka grew frightened of Kassapa’s power and, wishing to destroy it, appeared before the king at midnight and suggested to him that if he could persuade Kassapa to offer a sacrifice of slain beasts, he should be king over all India. The king, therefore, sent his minister Sayha, to fetch Kassapa to him. When Kassapa heard of the proposal he refused to go, but Sakka appeared again before the king and said that if the king’s daughter, Candavadī, were offered as reward, Kassapa would come. This proposal was agreed to, and Kassapa, tempted by the princess’s beauty, agreed to come. The people gathered at the place of sacrifice and tried to dissuade Kassapa from slaying the animals, but he refused to listen. Many beasts were slain, and as he raised his sword to cut off the head of the royal elephant the latter raised a cry in which all the animals joined.

'losaka jātaka':['In the time of Kassapa Buddha there lived a monk who was maintained by a rich man of the district. Into the monastery belonging to this rich man there came one day an arahant, and the former, liking his appearance, asked him to stay in the monastery, promising to look after him. The arahant agreed, but the incumbent of the monastery grew jealous and told their patron that the arahant was lazy and good for nothing. Some food sent by the patron for the arahant the incumbent threw into the embers. The arahant, reading his thoughts, left and went elsewhere. The monk was seized with remorse and was reborn in hell. In five hundred successive births he was a Yakkha, with never enough to eat; during a further five hundred births he was a dog. Then he was born, under the name of Mittavindaka, in a poor family in Kāsi. Because of him, dire misfortune befell the family, and he was driven out. In Benares he became a charity scholar under the Bodhisatta, who was a teacher there, but he was so quarrelsome that he was sent away. He married a poor woman and had two children. For a while he was a teacher, but the village in which he lived earned the king’s displeasure seven times, their houses caught fire and the water dried up. Having discovered the cause, the villagers drove out Mittavindaka and his family. In a haunted forest the wife and children were eaten up by demons.<br>In his wanderings Mittavindaka came to a coastal village, Gambhīra, where he took service in a ship. On the seventh day of the voyage the ship suddenly stopped sailing. Lots were cast, and seven times the lot fell on Mittavindaka, so they put him on a raft and lowered him overboard. He was cast ashore on an island where lived four vimāna petas in palaces of crystal, and he enjoyed happiness with them for seven days. From there he went to an island where lived eight goddesses in palaces of silver, thence to another where lived sixteen in palaces of jewels, thence to another still where lived thirty two in palaces of gold. In each he stayed seven days. From the last he went to an island of ogres. There he seized an ogress wandering about in the shape of a goat, and, when she kicked him, he was hurled into the dry moat of Benares. There goatherds were keeping watch for thieves, and when Mittavindaka seized a goat, hoping to be kicked back to his original place, he was caught. As he was being led away, the Bodhisatta saw and recognized him and persuaded the goatherds to allow him to have him as a slave.<br>The story was told in reference to Losaka Tissa, with whom Mittavindaka is identified. J.i.234 46.'],
'losaka tissa thera':['He was the son of a fisherman of Kosala. In his village lived one thousand families, and on the day of his conception they all had to starve and various misfortunes gradually befell them. By a process of exclusion, they discovered that their misfortunes were due to Losaka’s family, and therefore drove them out. As soon as Losaka could walk, his mother put a potsherd into his hand and sent him to beg. He wandered about uncared for, picking up lumps of rice like a crow. One day, when he was seven years old, Sāriputta saw him and, feeling pity for him, ordained him. But he was always unlucky; wherever he went, begging for alms, he received but little and never had a real meal. In due course he became an arahant, and when the time came for him to die Sāriputta determined that he should have a proper meal. He went with Losaka to Sāvatthi, but no one would even notice them. He then took Losaka back to the monastery and, having collected food himself, sent it to Losaka, but the messengers entrusted with it ate it all themselves. It was afternoon when Sāriputta discovered this; he therefore went to the king’s palace and, having obtained a bowl filled with catumadhura (honey, ghee, butter and sugar), took it to Losaka and asked him to eat out of the bowl as he (Sāriputta) held it, in case the food should disappear. That night Losaka died, and a shrine was erected over his ashes (J.i.234f). When the Buddha was asked why Losaka was so unlucky, he related the Losaka Jātaka (q.v.). Losaka is identified with Mittavindaka of that story.'],

'macchuddāna jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once the son of a landed proprietor, and, after his father’s death, he and his younger brother went to a village to settle some business. On their way back, they had a meal out of a leaf bottle, and, when they had finished, the Bodhisatta threw the remains into the river for the fish, giving the merit to the river spirit. The power of the river spirit increased and she discovered the cause. The younger brother was of a dishonest disposition, and when the elder was asleep, he packed a parcel of gravel to resemble the money they were carrying and put them both away. While they were in mid river he stumbled against the side of the boat and dropped overboard what he thought to be the parcel of gravel, but what was really the money. He told the Bodhisatta about it who said, ”Never mind, what’s gone has gone.” But the river spirit out of gratitude to the Bodhisatta made a fish swallow the parcel. The fish was later caught and hawked about, and, owing again to the influence of the spirit, the fisherman asked one thousand pieces and seven annas for it, and the people laughed at what they thought was a joke. But when they came to the Bodhisatta’s house, they offered him the fish for seven annas. The fish was bought and cut open by his wife, and the money was given to him. At that instant the river spirit informed him of what she had done and asked him to have no consideration for his brother, who was a thief and was greatly disappointed at the failure of his trick.

The fishermen hauled him up and left him on the sand while they proceeded to light a fire and whittle a spit whereon to roast him. The fish lamented, saying how unhappy his wife would be, thinking he had gone off with another. The Bodhisatta, who was the king’s priest, coming along to the river to bathe, heard the lament of the fish and obtained his freedom from the fishermen.<br>The story was related to a passion tossed monk who longed for the wife of his lay days. The two fish were the monk and his seducer.

Seeing this, the Bodhisatta approached Pajjuna, god of rain, and made an Act of Truth, begging for rain. The request succeeded, and heavy rain fell.<br>The story was told in reference to a great drought in Kosala. Even the pond by the gate of Jetavana was dry, and the Buddha, touched by the universal suffering, resolved to obtain rain. On his way back from the alms round, he sent Ananda to fetch the robe in which he bathed. As he was putting this on, Sakka’s throne was heated, and he ordered Pajjuna to send rain.

It is said (S.i.27f) that seven hundred devas of the Satullapa group visited the Buddha there and told him of their great admiration for his qualities. Māra tried to stir up discontent in the Buddha, but had to retire discomfited (S.i.110; this visit of Māra is referred to at D.ii.116).<br>According to the Commentaries (e.g., S.A.i.61; cp. J.iii.121f), Maddakucchi was so called because it was there that Bimbisāra’s queen, mother of Ajātasattu, tried to bring about an abortion when she was told by soothsayers that the child in her womb was destined to bring about Bimbisāra’s death. She went into the park unknown to the king and violently massaged her womb, but without success. The king heard of this and forbade her to visit the park.<br>Once when Mahā Kappina was at Maddakucchi, doubts arose in his mind as to the necessity of joining the assembly of monks for the holding of uposatha, he himself being pure.

When she came back from her quest for food later than usual, the gods having contrived to detain her, she found the children missing, and searched for them throughout the night. It was at dawn the next day, on her recovery from a death like swoon, that Vessantara told her of the gift of the children, describing the miracles, which had attended the gift and showing how they presaged that he would reach Enlightenment.

Kaccāna explains that where there is eye and visible form, visual consciousness arises, this begets contact, contact conditions feeling, what a man feels he perceives, what he perceives he reasons about, and this leads to obsession. It is the same with the other senses. The monks report this explanation to the Buddha, who approves of it and praises Kaccāna’s earning and insight.

'mahaka sutta':['Once a number of monks staying in the Ambātakagrove in Macchikāsanda were entertained by Citta-gahapati to a sumptuous meal. At the end of the meal, Citta, escorted them back to the monastery. On the way the monks were overcome by the heat, and Mahaka, the junior monk, with the permission of his senior, made by his magic power a cool wind to blow and wrought a thunderstorm accompanied by gentle rain. Citta was greatly impressed, and, seeking Mahaka in his cell, asked him to perform some miracle. Mahaka told him to put his cloak on the veranda and to scatter a bundle of grass on it. Then he retired to his cell, locked the door, and caused a flame to dart through the keyhole and burn the grass without damaging the cloak. Citta was overcome with surprise, and promised to supply Mahaka with all requisites. Mahaka thanked him, but soon after left Macchikāsanda never to return. Because he did not wish to enjoy gains won by a display of iddhi power; S.vi.288ff.; the story is also referred to at Vsm. 393.'],

'mahā ariṭṭha':['Nephew of Devānampiyatissa. He was the king’s chief minister, and led the embassy which was sent to Asoka soon after Devānampiyatissa ascended the throne (Mhv.xi.20). Asoka conferred on him the title of Senāpati (Mhv.xi.25). It is said that he had fifty five elder and younger brothers who all joined the Order at Cetiyagiri at the end of a sermon by Mahinda on the Vassūpanāyikakhandha (Mhv.xvi.10). This was before the commencement of the rainy season, but elsewhere (Mhv.xviii.3; perhaps here we have to deal with two different traditions) it is said that Arittha was sent in the month of Assayuja - after the pavāraṇa, when the rains were over - to Pātaliputta to fetch Sanghamittā and the Bodhi tree from the court of Asoka, and that, he agreed to go only on condition that he should join the Order on his return. The king consented, and, his mission successfully concluded, he entered the Order with five hundred others and attained arahantship (Mhv.xix.5, 12, 66). He died in the reign of Uttiya (Mhv.xx.54).<br>The Samantapāsādikā (Sp.i.102ff) gives an account of a recital (sangīti) held in Ceylon by Mahā Arittha.

'mahā assāroha jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares, and having been defeated in some frontier disturbance, he fled on his horse till he reached a certain village. At sight of him all the people disappeared except one man, who made enquiries, and, on finding that he was no rebel, took him home and entertained him with great honour, looking well after his horse. When the king left, he told the man that his name was Mahā Assāroha, and asked him to visit his home if ever he should be in the city. On reaching the city himself, he gave orders to the gate keepers that if anyone should come enquiring for Mahā Assāroha, he should be brought at once to the palace. Time passed and the man failed to appear. The king, therefore, constantly increased the taxes of the village, until the villagers asked their neighbour to visit his friend Mahā Assāroha and try to obtain some relief. So he prepared presents for Mahā Assāroha and his wife, and taking a cake baked in his own house he set forth. Arrived at the city gates, he was conducted by the gate keeper to the palace. There the king accepted his presents, showed him all the honours due to a king, and, in the end, gave him half of his kingdom. When the ministers complained, through the medium of the king’s son, that a mere villager had been exalted to the rank of king, the Bodhisatta explained that real friends who help one in time of adversity should be paid every honour.<br>The story was related in reference to the good offices of Ananda, who is identified with the villager. J.iii.8 13.'],
'mahā kaccāna bhaddekaratta sutta':['Samiddhi was once drying himself after bathing at Tapodā in Rājagaha, when a deity appeared before him and asked if he knew theBhaddekaratta Sutta. On his replying in the negative, the deity asked him to learn it, and the next day Samiddhi sought the Buddha and learnt the verses of the sutta.<br>Samiddhi and his colleagues then went to Mahā Kaccāna and urged him to explain the sutta in detail. This he did, for which they were very grateful. They repeated Kaccāna’s exposition to the Buddha, who greatly approved of it. (M.133)'],
'mahā kammavibhaṅga sutta':['Potaliputta comes to Samiddhi in his forest hut, near Veluvana in Rājagaha, and tells him that the Buddha has declared that all one says or does is vain; the only thing of importance is that which passes in one’s mind. Samiddhi protests against this, and when Potaliputta says, ”Tell me, what does a man experience who acts of set purpose?” gives his own explanation. Potaliputta then goes away without further talk and seeks Ananda, to whom he reports the incident. Ananda takes him to the Buddha, remarking that Samiddhi should not have given a single direct reply to a question, which required careful qualifications in the answer. Lāludāyi interrupts and is rebuked by the Buddha, who explains that the question was essentially a triple one and should have been so answered. If a man’s purposeful act is calculated to produce a pleasant feeling, his experience is pleasant; if an unpleasant feeling, unpleasant; if neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it is neither. Ananda asks him to explain further, and this he does. A man may be wicked in this world and yet, at death, pass either into heaven or into hell, he may be good yet go into hell or into heaven. But one should not rush to conclusions from this truth, because the consequence of man’s action, good or bad, may be felt either here and now, in the next birth, or at some other time. Kamma can be divided into four classes:<br>(1) not only in operation, but also having the appearance of being so; (2) in operation, though not appearing so; (3) in operation, and appearing so; (4) not in operation, and not appearing so. (M.136).'],
'mahā kotthita':['One of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, ranked foremost among masters of logical analysis (patisambhidappattānam) (A.i.24; Dpv.iv.5; v. 9). He was born into a very wealthy brahmin family of Sāvatthi, his father being Assalāyana and his mother Candavatī.<br>He gained great proficiency in the Vedas and, after hearing the Buddha preach (to his father, says the Apadāna account), entered the Order and, engaging in meditation, soon became an arahant.<br>He was extremely skilled in knowledge of thePatisambhidā, on which were based all his questions to the Buddha and his own colleagues.<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha he was a rich householder, and, hearing the Buddha praise a monk as foremost among those skilled in the Patisambhidā, he wished for similar eminence for himself in the future. To this end he visited the Buddha and his monks and entertained them for seven days, giving them three robes each at the conclusion of his almsgiving. Owing to the skill showed by him in theMahā Veddha Sutta, the Buddha declared him foremost among those skilled in the Patisambhidā (Thag.vs.2; ThagA.i.29ff.; AA.i.159; Ap.ii.479; also Avadānas ii.195).<br>Several instances are given of discussions between Kotthita and other eminent theras - e.g., the Nalakalāpiya Sutta on kamma (S.ii.112f), the Sīla Sutta on religious discipline (S.iii.165ff), three suttas on samudaya-dhamma (the nature of arising), two on assāda (satisfaction) (S.iii.172-7), two on samudaya (arising) (S.iii.173) and three on avijjā and vijjā (S.iii.17). Another similar sutta is on sense and sense objects (S.iv.162-5), and there is a series of suttas on matters not revealed by the Buddha (avyākatāni). S.iv.384-91; Mrs. Rhys Davids suggests (KS.i.79i n.1) that all these suttas were compiled rather as ”lessons” to be learnt than as genuine inquiries by Kotthita. The pre eminent monks were ”playing” at teacher and pupil in order to aid Kotthita to win proficiency as a teacher. Another such ”lesson” is given at A.iv.382ff., as to the motives guiding those who live the brahmacariya life.<br>All these suttas took the form of discussions withSāriputta, in which Mahā Kotthita is the questioner and Sāriputta the instructor.<br>One sutta (S.iv.145 7) records a ”lesson” given by the Buddha to Kotthita on conceptions of anicca, dukkha and anattā. The Anguttara Nikāya (see theKāyasakkhi Sutta, A.i.118f) records a discussion at Jetavana between Savittha, Kotthita and Sāriputta, as to who is best: one who has testified to the truth with body, one who has won view, or one released by faith. Another discussion (A.ii.161f) takes place between Sāriputta and Kotthita as to whether anything continues to exist after the ending of the six spheres of contact (Nibbāna). Once there was a dispute between Kotthita and Citta Hatthisāriputta; Citta was constantly interrupting the elder monks who were gathered at Isipatana for the discussion of the Abhidhamma, and was asked by Kotthita to abide his time and not interrupt. Citta’s friends protested that Citta was well qualified to take part in the discussion; but Kotthita declared that, far from being wise enough, Citta would, not long after, renounce the Order. And so it happened (A.iii.392ff).<br>Sāriputta evidently had a great regard for Kotthita; the Theragāthā (Thag.vss.1006 8; ThagA.ii.117) contains three stanzas in which Sāriputta proclaims his excellence.'],
'mahā moggallāna thera':['The second of the Chief Disciples of the Buddha. He was born in Kolitagāma near Rājagaha, on the same day as Sāriputta (they were both older than the Buddha), and was called Kolita after his village. His mother was a brahminee called Moggalī (Moggallāni), and his father was the chief, householder of the village. Moggallāna’s and Sāriputta’s families had maintained an unbroken friendship for seven generations, and so the children were friends from their childhood. Sāriputta had five hundred golden palanquins and Moggallāna five hundred carriages drawn by thoroughbreds. One day the two friends went together to see a mime play (giraggasamajjā), and there, realizing the impermanence of things, decided to renounce the world. They first lived as disciples of Sañjaya, and then wandered all over Jambudīpa, discussing with all learned men, but finding no satisfaction. Then they separated, after agreeing that whoever first succeeded in finding what they sought should inform the other.<br>After some time, Sāriputta, wandering about in Rājagaha, met Assaji, was converted by him to the faith of the Buddha, and became a sotāpanna. He found Moggallāna and repeated the stanza he had heard from Assaji (ye dhammā hetuppabhavā, etc.), and Moggallāna also became a sotāpanna. The two then resolved to visit the Buddha at Veluvana, after an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Sañjaya to accompany them. Sañjaya’s disciples, however, five hundred in number, agreed to go, and they all arrived at Veluvana. The Buddha preached to them, and ordained them by the ”ehi bhikkhu pabbajjā.” All became arahants except Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Moggallāna went to the hamlet of Kallavāla (for details see Pacala Sutta, A.iv.85f, where the village is called Kallavālamutta) in Magadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness overcame him as he sat meditating. The Buddha knew this, and appearing before him, exhorted him to be zealous. That very day he attained arahantship.<br>On the day that Sāriputta and Moggallāna were ordained, the Buddha announced in the assembly of monks that he had assigned to them the place of Chief Disciples and then recited the Pātimokkha. The monks were offended that newcomers should be shown such great honour. But the Buddha told them how these two had for a whole asankheyya and one hundred thousand years streṇuously exerted themselves to win this great eminence under him. They had made the first resolve in the time of Anomadassī Buddha. Moggallāna had been a householder, named Sirivaddha, and Sāriputta a householder, called Sarada. Sarada gave away his immense wealth and became an ascetic. The Buddha visited him in his hermitage, where Sarada and his seventy four thousand pupils showed him great honour. Anomadassī’s chief disciple, Nisabha, gave thanks, and Sarada made a vow that he would become the chief disciple of some future Buddha. Anomadassī saw that his wish would be fulfilled and told him so.<br>After the Buddha’s departure, Sarada went to Sirivaddka, and, announcing the Buddha’s prophecy, advised Sirivaddha to wish for the place of second disciple. Acting on this advice, Sirivaddha made elaborate preparations and entertained the Buddha and his monks for seven days. At the end of that time, he announced his wish to the Buddha, who declared that it would be fulfilled. From that time, the two friends, in that and subsequent births, engaged in good deeds. AA.i.84ff.; Ap.ii.31ff.; DhA.i.73f.; SNA.i.326ff.; the story of the present is given in brief at Vin.i.39ff.<br>Sāriputta and Moggallāna are declared to be the ideal disciples, whose example others should try to follow (E.g., S.ii.235; A.i.88). In the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta (M.iii.248) the Buddha thus distinguishes these ”twin brethren” from the others: ”Sāriputta is as she who brings forth and Moggallāna is as the nurse of what is brought forth; Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good. Sāriputta is able to teach and make plain the four Noble Truths; Moggallāna, on the other hand, teaches by his iddhi-pātihāriya.” (BuA.31) Moggallāna’s pre eminence lay in his possession of iddhi power (A.i.23). He could create a living shape innumerable times and could transfer himself into any shape at will. Thag.vs.1183; he is recorded as saying that he could crush Sineru like a kidney bean (DhA.iii.212), and, rolling the earth like a mat between his fingers, could make it rotate like a potter’s wheel, or could place the earth on Sineru like an umbrella on its stand. When the Buddha and his monks failed to get alms in Verañjā, Moggallāna offered to turn the earth upside down, so that the essence of the earth, which lay on the under surface, might serve as food. He also offered to open a way from Nalerupu-cimanda to Uttarakuru, that the monks might easily go there for alms; but this offer was refused by the Buddha (Vin.iii.7; Sp.i.182f.; DhA.ii.153).<br>Several instances are given of this special display of iddhi. Once, at the Buddha’s request, with his great toe he shook the Migāramātupāsāda, and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper storey. See Pasādakampana Sutta, S.v.269ff.; also the Utthāna Sutta, SNA.i.336f.<br>On another occasion, when Moggallāna visited Sakka to find out if he had profited by the Buddha’s teaching, he found him far too proud and obsessed by the thought of his own splendour. He thereupon shook Sakka’s palace, Vejayanta, till Sakka’s hair stood on end with fright and his pride was humbled (See Cūlataṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta, M.i.251ff). Again, Moggallāna is mentioned as visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance of Baka Brahmā. He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the Sudhammā-Hall in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views were erroneous. Thag.vs.1198; ThagA.ii.185; S.i.144f. ; other visits of his to the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa Brahmā (A.iii.331ff.; iv.75ff.; cp. Mtu.i.54ff.).<br>In the Māratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.332ff) we are told how Māra worried Moggallāna by entering into his belly, but Moggallāna ordered him out and told him how he himself had once been a Māra named Dūsī whose sister Kālī was the mother of the present Māra. Dūsī incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.<br>But, according to the Commentaries (E.g., ThagA.ii.188ff), Moggallāna’s greatest exhibition of iddhi power was the subjugation of the Nāga Nandopananda. No other monk could have survived the ordeal because no other was able to enter so rapidly into the fourth jhāna; which was the reason why the Buddha would give permission to no other monk but Moggallāna to quell the Nāga’s pride. Similar, in many ways, was his subjection of the Nāga who lived near the hermitage of Aggidatta (DhA.iii.242) (q.v.). Moggallāna could see, without entering into any special state of mind, petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye (See, e.g., DhA.ii.64; iii.60, 410f., 479; S.ii.254ff.; where he saw petas while in the company of Lakkhana; cp. Avadānas i.246ff.). He would visit various worlds and bring back to the Buddha reports of their inhabitants (see also Mtu.i.4ff. regarding his visit to the Nirayas), which the Buddha used in illustration of his sermons. The Vimānavatthu (see also DhA.iii.291, re Nandiya, and iii.314) contains a collection of stories of such visits, and we are told (S.v.366f) that Moggallāna’s visits to the deva worlds - e.g., that to Tāvatimsa were very welcome to the devas.<br>Though Moggallāna’s pre eminence was in iddhi power, yet in wisdom, too, he was second only to Sāriputta. These two could answer questions within the range of no other disciple of the Buddha (DhA.iii.227). The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggallāna’s powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the Sākyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggallāna, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary. And Moggallāna spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of them. At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly (S.iv.183ff). Mention is made elsewhere (S.iv.262-9) of eloquent sermons preached by him on the jhānas, on qualities which lead to true emancipation (A.v.155ff), and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach. Other devas also went to hear him - e.g., Candana, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti (S.iv. 269 80). He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta (E.g., S.iv.391ff), and Vappa (A.ii.196ff), eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha. When the Buddha went to preach the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa, it was to Moggallāna that he entrusted the task of preaching to the people who were waiting for his return. Moggallāna, therefore, provided for these people spiritually, while Anāthapindika looked after their bodily needs (DhA.iii.219). When the time drew near for the Buddha’s return, Moggallāna, at the request of the people, went to Tāvatimsa, diving into the earth and climbing Sineru, in full view of them all, in order to find out what the Buddha intended doing, so that the people might be kept informed (DhA.224; J.iv.265; cp. Dvy.375). No task, which he might be told by the Buddha to perform, seemed to Moggallāna too insignificant. Thus we find him employed by the Buddha as messenger to the arahant Uggasena, telling him that the Buddha wished to see him (Ibid., iv.62). He was also sent to Sakkhara, to Macchariya Kosiya, to check his miserliness and bring him to Jetavana (Ibid., i.369f.; J.i.347); and to Sīlavā, whom Ajātasattu was plotting to kill (ThagA.i.536). When Visakhā was building the Migāramātupāsāda and the Buddha was away on one of his journeys, Moggallāna, because of his iddhi power, and five hundred monks were left to supervise the work, which was carried through without difficulty (DhA.i.414f). The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure. There is one instance recorded of Moggallāna seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door (A.iv.204ff.). Once, when a monk charged Sāriputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggallāna and Ananda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear Sāriputta vindicate himself (Vin.ii.236; A.iv.374).<br>Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahmā singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kokālika monk (Kokalika had a great hatred of them - e.g., A.v.170ff.; SN., p. 231ff.; SNA.ii.473ff). When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gayāsīsa, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to bring them back. They were successful in this mission (DhA.i.143ff.; see also DhA.ii.109f., where they were sent to admonish the Assajipunabbasukā). Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggallāna and later born in a huge manomayakāya, had warned Moggallāna of Devadatta’s intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggallāna (Vin.ii.185; A.iii.122ff). When Rāhula, the Buddha’s son, was ordained, Sāriputta was his preceptor and Moggallāna his teacher (J.i.161; see SNA.i.304f., where the account is slightly different. There Moggallāna is spoken of as Rāhula’s kammavācāriya.). Moggallāna seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks’ welfare. Among the verses, attributed to him in the Theragāthā, are several containing exhortations to his colleagues (Thag.vss.1146-9, 1165f ); some of the colleagues are mentioned by name - e.g., Tissa, Vaddhamāna and Potthila (Ibid., 1162, 1163, 1174f). Elsewhere (S.i.194f) mention is made of his living at Kālasilā, with a company of five hundred monks, watching over them and discovering that all were arahants. Vangīsa witnessed this and praised Moggallāna in verse before the Buddha.<br>The love existing between Moggallāna and Sāriputta was mutual, as was the admiration. Sāriputta’s verses in praise of Moggallāna (Thag.vss.1178 81) are even more eloquent than those of Moggallāna in praise of Sāriputta (Thag.vss.1176). Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye. E.g., S.ii.275ff.; Moggallāna elsewhere also (S.ii.273f.) tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers. For another discussion between Sāriputta and Moggallāna, see A.ii.154f.<br>In the Mahāgosinga Sutta (M.i.212) we find them staying in the Gosingasālavana in the company of Mahā Kassapa, Ananda, Revata and Anuruddha, engaged in friendly discussion, referring their conclusions to the Buddha for his opinion. Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and Anuruddha are again mentioned (S.v.174f., 299) as staying in the Ketakīvana in Sāketa. Among discussions between Anuruddha and Moggallāna is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of the value of cultivating the four satipatthānas (S.v.294f). It seems to have been usual for Sāriputta and Moggallāna, in their journeys, to travel together at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were anxious to include them in their invitations. Velukandaki in Dakkhinagiri (A.iii.336; iv.63); and Cittagahapati in Macchikāsanda (DhA.ii.74f.).<br>Moggallāna died before the Buddha, Sāriputta dying before either. The Theragāthā contains several verses attributed to Moggallāna regarding Sāriputta’s death (vs.1158 61). Sāriputta died on the full moon day of Kattika and Moggallāna two weeks later, on the new moon day (SA.iii.181).<br>According to the Commentaries (J.v.125ff) his death resulted from a plot of the Niganthas. Moggallāna used to visit various worlds and return with his report that he had discovered that those who followed the Buddha’s teaching reached happy worlds, while the followers of the heretics were reborn in woeful conditions. These statements diminished the number of the heretics and they bribed brigands to kill Moggallāna. They surrounded the Elder’s cell in Kālasilā, but he, aware of their intentions, escaped through the keyhole. On six successive days this happened; on the seventh, they caught him and beat him, crushing his bones and leaving him for dead. Having recovered consciousness, with a great effort of will, he dragged himself to the Buddha in order to take his leave, and there he died, to the sorrow of the deva worlds. This sad death is said to have been the result of a sin committed by him in a previous birth. Acting on the instigation of his wife, he had taken his blind parents into a forest, where, pretending that they were attacked by thieves, he had beaten them to death. For this deed he suffered in hell for innumerable years, and in his last birth lost his life by violence.<br>The account in DhA.iii.65ff. differs in several details. The thieves tried for two months before succeeding in their plot and, in the story of the past, when the blind parents were being beaten, they cried out to the supposed thieves to spare their son. Moggallāna, very touched by this, did not kill them. Before passing into Nibbāna, he preached to the Buddha, at his request, and performed many miracles, returning to Kālasilā to die. According to the Jātaka account his cremation was performed with much honour, and the Buddha had the relics collected and a Thūpa erected in Veluvana.<br>Moggallāna’s body was of the colour of the blue lotus or the rain cloud (Bu.i.58). There exists in Ceylon an oral tradition that this colour is due to his having suffered in hell in the recent past!<br>Moggallāna is connected with characters in several Jātakas: thus, he was<br>Kisavaccha in the Indriya Jātaka (J.iii.469), Sakka in the Illīsa (i. 354), one of the devas in the Kakkāru (iii.90), the tortoise in the Kurungamiga (ii.155), Candasena in the Khandahāla (vi. 157), the senāpati in the Cullasutasoma (v. 192), the youngest bird in the Javanahamsa (iv. 218), the elephant in the Tittira (i. 220), the tiger in the Tittira (iii.543), Ayura in the Dasannaka (iii.341), the jackal in the Pañcūposatha (iv. 332), Suriya in the Bilārikosiya (iv. 69), one of the brothers in the Bhisa (iv. 314), Subhaga in the Bhūridatta (vi. 219), the old tortoise in the Mahāukkusa (iv. 297), Migājina in the Mahājanaka (vi. 68), Bījaka in the Mahānāradakassapa (vi. 255), the king’s charioteer in the Rājovāda (ii.5), the tiger in the Vannāroha (iii.193), the Garula king in the Vidhurapaṇḍita (vi. 329), the tiger in the Vyaggha (ii.358), the rat in the Saccankara (i. 32), Bhadrakāra in the Sambhava (v. 67), Kisavaccha in the Sambhaṅga (v. 151), the jackal in the Sasa (iii.56), Canda in the Sudhābhojana (v. 412), and Gopāla in the Hatthipāla (iv. 491).'],

Mahā Sangharakkhita. A monk of Corakaṇḍaka vihāra; one of those who accepted the meal given by Prince Sāliya in his previous birth as a blacksmith. MT. 606.<br>3. Mahā Sangharakkhita. Called Malayavāsi Mahā Sangharakkhita or Uparimandalakamalayavāsī. Tissabhūti went to him, on finding his mind corrupted by sinful thoughts, and having received from Sangharakkhita a topic of meditation, he attained to arahantship (AA.i.23f.; MA.i.55). He was one of the last of the arahants. J. L. Makārakkhira.J.iv.490; vi.30.<br>4. Mahā Sangharakkhita. Mentioned in the Commentaries as being free from impurities.

When over sixty years old and about to die, his companions questioned him on his transcendental attainment. ”I have none,” he replied. A young monk who waited on him said that people had come from twelve yojanas round in the belief that he had attained Nibbāna. He then asked that he should be raised up and left alone. As soon as the others left him, he snapped his fingers to show that he had attained arahantship. He confessed that he had never done anything without mindfulness and understanding. His nephew also attained arahantship only after fifty years of age. Vsm.47f.<br>6. Mahā-Sangharakkhita.-An arahant thera who preached to Rūpadevī (q.v.).'],
'mahā ukkusa jātaka':['Not far from a certain village settlement a hawk lived on the south shore of a lake. He courted a female hawk on the western shore, and, at her suggestion, made friends with an osprey on the west side, a lion on the north and a tortoise on an island in the lake. Later, the hawks had two sons, who lived on the island. One day, some men, wandering about in search of food, lay down under the tree where the hawks lived and kindled a fire to keep away the insects. The smoke disturbed the young ones and they set up a cry. The men, hearing this, wished to get the birds for their food. But the she hawk, perceiving the danger, sent her husband to summon their friends. First came the osprey who brought water in his wings and quenched the fire every time it was lighted; when he was tired, the tortoise sent his son with mud from the lake, which he put on the fire. The men caught the tortoise and tied it with creepers, but he plunged into the water, dragging the men with him. Then the lion appeared, and at his first roar the men fled, and the friends rejoiced over the firmness of their friendship.<br>The story was told in reference to Mittagandhaka (q.v.) and his wife. They were the hawks of the story. Rāhula was the young tortoise and Moggallāna the father tortoise. Sāriputta was the osprey and the Bodhisatta the lion. J.iv.288-97.'],

For a description see Geiger’s Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa, pp. 44, 63, etc.<br>The Mahā-aṭṭhakathā was the chief source from which Buddhaghosa drew his materials for his Commentaries and is often referred to in his works, particularly in the Samantapāsādikā.

'mahāariyavaṃsa sutta':['On the four Ariyan lineages, reckoned as ancient and pure, and held in esteem by discerning recluses and brahmins of all times. A monk is content with any kind of robe; he does not, for the sake of robes, resort to unseemly conduct; he is free from either selfishness or greed with regard to robes; neither does he exalt himself because of his contentment. So it is with other requisites. He also delights in abandoning and in bhāvanā. A monk possessed of these four Ariyavaṃsā verily becomes a sage, praised by Brahmā himself (A.ii.27ff).<br>This sutta was evidently a favourite topic for a sermon (AA.i.385, 386). The Commentary explains (AA.ii.494) how, for instance, anyone who preaches on the first three Ariyavaṃsā (catupaccayasantosa) could bring the whole Vinaya Pitaka to bear on the discussion, while a discussion on the bhāvanārāma-ariyavaṃsa could include the two other Pitakas, chiefly the nekkhammapāli of the Patisambhidāmagga, the Dasuttara Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya, the Satipatthāna Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya, and the Niddesapariyāya of the Abhidhamma.<br>The full name of the sutta seems to have been Catupaccayasantosabhāvanārāma Mahāariyavaṃsa Sutta (AA.i.385). It was also probably called Vamsa Sutta for short.<br>It is probably this Mahāariyavaṃsa Sutta which was held in such high esteem by Vohāraka Tissa, that he ordered almsgiving throughout Ceylon whenever the ”Ariyavamsa” was read (Mhv.xxxvi.38; but see Mhv.Trs.258, n. 6). It is said that people would journey five yojanas to hear a monk preach the Ariyavamsa (E.g., AA.i.386), and mention is made of Mahāariyavaṃsabhānakā, who, judging from the stories of them (E.g., SA.iii.151), were extremely able and eloquent preachers.'],

'mahābodhi jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was born in an Udiccabrahmin family, and, on growing up, renounced the world. His name was Bodhi.<br>Once, during the rains, he came to Benares, and, at the invitation of the king, stayed in the royal park. The king had five councillors, unjust men, who sat in the judgment hall giving unjust judgments. One day a man, who had been very badly treated by them, asked Bodhi to intervene. Bodhi reheard the case and decided in his favour. The people applauded, and the king begged Bodhi to dispense justice in his court. Bodhi reluctantly agreed and twelve years passed. The former councillors, deprived of their gains, plotted against Bodhi and constantly poisoned the king’s mind against him; they first decreased all the honours paid to Bodhi, and when this failed to drive him away, obtained the king’s permission to kill him.<br>A tawny dog, to whom Bodhi used to give food from his bowl, overheard the plot, and, when Bodhi approached the palace the next day, bared his teeth and barked as a warning of the conspiracy. Bodhi understood, returned to his hut, and, in spite of the king’s expression of remorse, left the city, promising to return later, and dwelt in a frontier village. The councillors, nervous lest Bodhi should return, informed the king that Bodhi and the queen were conspiring to slay him. Believing their words, he had the queen put to death. The queen’s four sons thereupon rose in revolt, and the king was in great danger and fear.<br>When Bodhi heard of this, he took a dried monkey skin, went to Benares, and stayed again in the royal park. The king came to do him honour, but Bodhi sat silent, stroking the monkey skin. The king asked him why he did so. He answered, ”This monkey was of the greatest service to me; I travelled about on its back, it carried my water pot, swept out my dwelling, and performed various other duties for me; in the end, through its simplicity, I ate its flesh and now I sit and lie on its skin.”<br>(He had used the skin for his garment, hence ”I sat on the monkey’s back”; he had the skin on his shoulder, whence his water pot was suspended, hence ”it carried the water pot”; he had swept the cell with the skin, hence ”swept my dwelling place”; he had eaten the flesh of the monkey, hence ”I ate its flesh”).<br>The councillors who were present made great uproar, calling him a murderer and a traitor. But Bodhi knew that of these councillors, one denied the effect of all kamma, one attributed everything to a Supreme Being, one believed that everything was a result of past actions, one believed in annihilation, and one held the khattiya doctrine that one should secure one’s interests, even to the extent of killing one’s parents. He, therefore, argued with one after another, and proved that in accordance with their doctrines no blame whatever attached to him for having killed the monkey. Having thus completed their discomfiture, he exhorted the king not to trust in slanderers, and asked the king’s sons to obtain their father’s pardon. The king wished the councillors to be killed, but Bodhi intervened, and they were disgraced and exiled from the kingdom, their hair fastened in five locks.<br>The story was related in the same circumstances as the Mahāummagga Jātaka. The five ministers are identified with<br>Pūrana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Pakudha Kaccāna, Ajita Kesakambala and Nigantha Nātaputta; the dog was Ananda. J.v.227 46; ep. Jātakamālā, xxiii.'],

When questioned by his fellows as to how he could refrain, he answered that as it was impossible for anybody young to die, he did not believe his friend was dead. The teacher asked him about this, and found that in Dhammapāla’s family no one died young. Wishing to know if this were true, he left Takkasilā and went to the home of Dhammapāla, carrying with him the bones of a goat. After his welcome had subsided, he announced to Dhammapāla that his son was dead, and begged him not to grieve. But Dhammapāla clapped his hands and laughed, saying that such a thing could never be as no member of their family ever died young. He then told the brahmin, in answer to his query, that they owed their longevity to the fact that they lived good lives.<br>The story was related to Suddhodana, who told the Buddha how, when the Buddha was practising severe penances, some gods came to him (Suddhodana) and said that he was dead.

Sakka, knowing what was to come, came in the guise of a labourer to help them.

'mahāgovinda sutta':['Pañcasikha visits theBuddha at Gijjhakūta and tells him of a meeting once held inTāvatimsa. At this meetingSakka rejoices with the devas of Tāvatimsa over the increase in their numbers owing to the appearance in their midst of new devas produced by the good kamma of the followers of the new view of life put forward by the Buddha. Sakka expresses his joy in a song and then utters an eulogy on the eight qualities of the Buddha. BrahmāSanankumāra appears and desires to hear the eulogy, which is, accordingly, repeated for his benefit. Sanankumāra says that the Buddha has ever been thus wise, and tells the story ofDisampati and his son Renu. Disampati has a purohita called Govinda and when he dies Disampati is distressed, but, at the suggestion of Renu, appoints Govinda’s sonJotipāla in his place.<br>On the death of Disampati Renu becomes king, and, with Jotipāla’s help, divides his kingdom into seven to be shared by himself and six of his friends, the divisions of the kingdom being:<br>Dantapura Potana Māhissati Roruka Mithilā Campā Bārānasiand the kings, respectively, are:<br>Sattabhū Brahmadatta Vessabhū Bharata Renu two DhataratthasJotipāla, now called Mahāgovinda by virtue of his post, trains seven others to fill the posts of stewards to the seven kings. Mahāgovinda acquires the reputation of having seen Brahmā face to face, and, in order to justify this reputation, he takes leave of Renu and practises meditation for four months. During his meditation, Sanankumāra appears before him and tells him that he may see Brahmā face to face and attain communion with him. Here we have the teaching regarding the ideal brahmin. Mahāgovinda decides to leave the world and carry out the teachings of Sanankumāra. Having obtained the leave of his master, he enters the homeless life, where he practises the four ecstasies of love, pity, sympathy in joy and equanimity. He teaches these to his disciples, and, after death, they are all born into the Brahma world.<br>At the end of Pañcasikha’s recital, the Buddha tells him that he himself was Mahāgovinda and therefore remembers all that life.

'mahāhamsa jātaka':['Khemā, wife of Samyama, king of Benares, had a dream, after which she longed to see a golden hamsa preach the law from the royal throne. When the king came to know this, he consulted various people, and, acting on their advice, had a pond dug to the north of the city in the hope of enticing a golden hamsa there, and appointed a fowler, who came to be called Khemaka, to look after the pond.<br>The plan succeeded. Five different kinds of geese came: the grass geese, the yellow geese, the scarlet geese, the white geese, and the pāka geese.<br>Dhatarattha, king of the golden geese, who lived in Cittakūta, had taken as wife a pakā goose, and at the repeated suggestion of his minister, Sumukha, arrived with his flock of ninety thousand, to see the wonderful pond at Benares. Khemaka saw them and waited his opportunity. On the seventh day he found it, and set a snare in which Dhatarattha was caught. At his cry of alarm the flock fled, with the exception of Sumukha, who stayed and asked Khemaka for permission to take Dhatarattha’s place. When Sumukha heard why they had been caught, he asked that both he and Dhatarattha should be taken before Samyama. When Samyama heard of Sumukha’s devotion he was greatly touched, and showed the hamsas every possible honour, after asking their forgiveness for the way they had been treated. Dhatarattha preached to the queen and the royal household, and, having exhorted the king to rule righteously, returned to Cittakūta.<br>The story was told in reference to Ananda’s attempt to sacrifice his own life for that of the Buddha, when Nālāgiri (q.v.) was sent to kill him.<br>Khemaka was Channa, Khemā the Therī Khemā, the king Sāriputta, Sumukha Ananda, and Dhatarattha the Bodhisatta.

'mahāhatthipadopama sutta':['Sāriputta addresses the monks at Jetavana and tells them that, just as the foot of every creature will fit in the elephant’s footprint, even so are all right states of mind comprised within the Four Noble Truths. He then goes on to explain that dukkha consists of the five upādānakkhandhas - visible shapes, feelings, perception, saṅkhāras and consciousness. The constituents of these attachments are the four principle elements: earth, water, fire, and air. Each element is of two kinds personal (ajjhatta) and external (bahiddhā) - and each is transient and subject to decay. The chain of causation entails all that makes up the five attachments. Where there is eye intact, on which external shapes come to focus, and where there is developed pertinent material to sustain it, there is developed a manifestation of the pertinent section of consciousness. Thus arises the upādānakkhandha of form; similarly with the others. M.28.'],
'mahājanapadā':['The books frequently mention* the sixteen Mahājanapadas or countries, which existed in the time of the Buddha.

'mahākaṇha jātaka':['In the past, when the teachings of Kassapa Buddha were already forgotten, there ruled a king named Usīnara. Monks and nuns lived in wickedness, and men followed evil paths, being born, after death, in the Niraya. Sakka, finding no one entering the deva worlds from among men, decided to scare the men into virtue. Assuming the guise of a forester and leading Mātali disguised as a black fierce looking dog called Mahākaṇha, Sakka came to the city gates and cried aloud that the world was doomed to destruction. The people fled in terror into the city and the gates were shut. But the forester leapt over the city wall with his dog, the latter scaring everyone he saw. The king shut himself up in his palace, but the dog put his forefeet on the palace window and set up a roar, which was heard from the hells to the highest heavens. The forester said the dog was hungry, and the king ordered food to be given him. But he ate it all in one mouthful and roared for more. Usīnara then asked the forester what kind of dog it was, and was told that the animal ate up all those who walked in unrighteousness, and described who the unrighteous were. Then having terrified everyone, Sakka revealed himself and returned to his heaven. The king and his people became virtuous, and Kassapa’s religion lasted for one thousand years more.<br>The story was told in reference to a conversation among the monks to the effect that the Buddha was always working for the good of others, never resting, never tiring, his compassion extended towards all beings. Mātali is identified with Ananda (J.iv.180 6).<br>The barking of Mahākaṇha was among the four sounds heard throughout Jambudīpa. SNA.i.223; see J.iv.182, where only three are mentioned.'],

She, thereupon, refused to take it back and had it sold. It was worth nine crores, the workmanship being worth one hundred thousand. No one was found able to buy it, so Visākhā herself paid the price for it, and, with the proceeds, erected theMigāramātupāsāda (DhA.i.411ff).<br>Mallikā, after the death of her husband, refused to wear her jewels, and, when the Buddha’s body was being taken for cremation, she washed her ornament in scented water and placed it on the Buddha’s bier with the following resolve: ” May I, in future births, have a body that shall need no ornaments, but which shall appear as though it always bore them (DA.ii.597).<br>The making of Visākhā’s ornament took four months, with five hundred goldsmiths working day and night.

The thread work was entirely of silver, the parure was fastened to the head and extended to the feet. In various places, seals of gold and dies of silver were attached to hold it in position.

'mahāli':['1. Mahāli<br>A Licchavi chief, mentioned as having visited the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā to ask if he had seen Sakka (S.i.230; DhA.i.263ff. add that the Buddha here related to him the story of Magha) and also to beg information as to the teachings ofPūrana Kassapa (S.iii.68). This conversation resulted from Mahāli having heard theSakkapañha Sutta. (SeeMahāli Sutta.)<br>Mahāli was educated at Takkasilā. After his return to Vesāli, he devoted himself to the education of the young Licchavi men, but, through overexertion, lost his sight. He continued to instruct them, however, and was given a house by the gate, which led from Sāvatthi into Vesāli. The revenue from this gate, worth one hundred thousand, was given to him (DhA.i.338). WhenBandhula came to Vesāli, to satisfy the pregnancy longings of his wife Mallikā, Mahāli, hearing the rumble of his chariot, instantly recognised it. He warned the Licchavis not to interfere with Bandhula, and, finding that they insisted on pursuing him, urged them to turn back when they saw Bandhula’s chariot sink up to the nave, or at least when they heard a, sound like the crash of a thunderbolt, or when they saw a hole in the yokes of the chariot. But they paid no heed to his warnings and were killed (DhA.i.350f.; J.iv.148f).<br>When the Licchavis decided to invite the Buddha to Vesāli, to rid the city of its plagues, Mahāli it was who went with the son of the purohita toVeluvana to intercede with Bimbisāra, that he might persuade the Buddha to come. Mahāli was a favourite of Bimbisāra and a member of his retinue. He had attained sotāpatti at the same time as the king (DhA.iii.438).<br>This Mahāli is perhaps identical with the Mahāli mentioned in the Apadāna (Ap.ii.494, vs.28) as the father of Sīvalī. His wife was Suppavāsā.<br>2. Mahāli. See Otthaddha.<br>3. Mahāli. A Sākiyan prince, one of seven grandsons of Amitodana.

'mahāli sutta':['1. Mahāli Sutta. The Licchavi Otthaddha (Mahāli) visits the Buddha at the Kutāgārasālā and reports to him a conversation he had had withSunakkhatta, who claimed to be able to see heavenly forms but not to hear heavenly sounds. Mahāli inquires how such a faculty can be acquired, and the Buddha tells him, but explains that it is not for the sake of acquiring these powers that people join the Order. Asking what then is their object, he gradually leads the conversation on to the question of arahantship, along the Eightfold Path. The Buddha then raises a quite different question, as to whether the soul and the body are identical. The discourse on this again leads to the question of arahantship (cp.Jāliya Sutta), but it is significant that the Buddha leaves this last question unanswered (D.i.150 8).<br>Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.316) that the Buddha raised the point of body and soul, because he knew that Mahāli harboured the heretical belief that a soul exists and that it has form.<br>2. Mahāli Sutta. The Licchavi Mahāli visits the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā and questions him regarding the doctrine of Pūrana Kassapa that there is no cause or condition for the impurity of beings. The Buddha contradicts this view, and explains that it is because beings take delight in the body, etc., that they become impure. When they feel revulsion towards the body, etc., they become pure. S.iii.68f.<br>3. Mahāli Sutta. The Buddha, in answer to a question of Mahāli, says that greed, ill will, dullness cause the continuance of evil action, and right reflection and a well poised mind cause the continuance of good. The existence of these two different sets of qualities cause the good and evil in the world. A.v.86f.'],

During the rains, his disciples went to Benares and dwelt in the king’s park, while Rakkhita stayed in the hermitage. At that time there was a great discussion going on among men as to what constituted auspiciousness, and Rakkhita’s disciples, on being consulted, said that Rakkhita would solve the problem. They, therefore, went to Rakkhita’s hermitage and asked him the question, which he answered in a series of eight verses. (The maṅgalas enumerated in these verses differ from those given in the Maṅgala Sutta). The disciples, having learnt the verses, returned to Benares, where they expounded them, thus setting all doubts at rest.<br>The story was related in reference to the preaching of the Mahāmaṅgala Sutta. It happened that in Rājagaha there was a large assembly at the Santhāgāra, and a man rose and went out, saying, ”This is a day of good omen.” Some one, hearing this, inquired the meaning of ”good omen.” One said, ”The sight of a lucky thing is a good omen.” But this was denied, and then began the discussion on omens, which, in the end, was carried to Sakka, and referred by him to the Buddha.<br>The senior disciple of Rakkhita is identified with Sāriputta (J.iv.72 9).'],

Devānampiyatissa gave the park to Mahinda for the use of the Order (Mhv.xv.8, 24; Dpv.xviii.18; Sp.i.81) and within its boundaries there came into being later the Mahā-Vihāra and its surrounding buildings. The fifteenth chapter of the Mahāvamsa (Mhv.xv.27ff) gives a list of the chief spots associated with the religion, which came into existence there. Chief among these are the sites of the Bodhi tree, the thirty two mālakas, the Catussālā, the Mahā Thūpa, the Thūpārāma, the Lohapāsāda, and various parivenas connected with Mahinda: Sunhāta, Dīghacankamana, Phalagga, Therāpassaya, Marugana and Dīghasandasenāpati.

On one occasion the king had to leave the city to quell a border rising, and, thinking the dangers too great to take his queen with him, he entrusted her to the care of Paduma. The campaign was victorious. In the course of making arrangements for the celebration of his father’s return, Paduma entered the queen’s apartments. She was struck by his amazing beauty, and fell in love with him, inviting him to lie with her. On his indignant refusal, she feigned illness, and, on the return of the king, falsely accused him of having ill treated her. The king gave orders, in spite of the protestations of the people, that Paduma should be thrown from the ”Robbers’ Cliff.” The deity of the mountain saved his life and entrusted him to the care of the Nāga king, who took him to his abode, where he stayed for one year. Paduma then went to the Himālaya and became an ascetic. The king heard of this and went to offer him the kingdom, but it was refused by Paduma. The king, convinced of the falsity of the charge brought against Paduma, caused the queen to be flung from the Robbers’ Cliff.<br>The story was related in reference to Ciñcamānavikā’s false accusations against the Buddha.

A monk asks the Buddha a series of questions regarding the five upādānakkhandhā, their origin, their definition, and also as to how notions of self come about (sakkāyaditthi).

M.iii.15-20.'],
'mahāpuññā':['Five persons of the Buddha’s day considered the most lucky:<br>the setthi Mendaka, his chief wife Candapadumā, his son Dhañañjaya, his daughter in law Sumanādevī, and his servant Punna. E.g., AA.i.219.'],
'mahāpurisa':['The name given to a Great Being, destined to become either a Cakka-vatti or a Buddha. He carries on his person the following thirty two marks (Mahāpurisalakkhanāni) (these are given at D.ii.17f.; iii.142ff.; M.ii.136f ):<br>he has feet of level tread; on his soles are marks of wheels with spokes, felloes and hubs; his heels project; his digits are long; his hands and feet are soft; his fingers and toes straight; his ankles like rounded shells; his legs like an antelope’s; standing, he can touch his knees without bending; his privacies are within a sheath; he is of golden hue; his skin so smooth that no dust clings to it; the down on his body forms single hairs; each hair is straight, blue black and at the top curls to the right; his frame is straight; his body has seven convex surfaces; his chest is like a lion’s; his back flat between the shoulders; his sheath is the same as his height; his bust is equally rounded; his taste is consummate; he has a lion’s jaws; has forty teeth; they are regular, and continuous; lustrous; his tongue is long; his voice like that of a karavīka bird; his eyes intensely black; his eyelashes like a cows; between his eyelashes are soft, white hairs like cotton down; his head is like a turban. The theory of Mahāpurisa is pre Buddhistic. Several passages in the Pitakas (E.g., D.i.89, 114, 120; A.i.163; M.ii.136; SN.vs.600, 1000, etc.) mention brahmins as claiming that this theory of the Mahāpurisa and his natal marks belonged to their stock of hereditary knowledge. The Buddhists, evidently, merely adopted the brahmin tradition in this matter as in so many others. But they went further. In the Lakkhana Sutta (D.iii.142ff) they sought to explain how these marks arose, and maintained that they were due entirely to good deeds done in a former birth and could only be continued in the present life by means of goodness. Thus the marks are merely incidental; most of them are so absurd, considered as the marks of a human being, that they are probably mythological in origin, and a few of them seem to belong to solar myths, being adaptations to a man, of poetical epithets applied to the sun or even to the personification of human sacrifice. Some are characteristic of human beauty, and one or two may possibly be reminiscences of personal bodily peculiarities possessed by some great man, such as Gotama himself.<br>Apart from these legendary beliefs, the Buddha had his own theory of the attributes of a Mahāpurisa as explained in the Mahāpurisa Sutta (S.v.158) and the Vassakāra Sutta (A.ii.35f).<br>Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.761) that when the time comes for the birth of a Buddha, the Suddhāvāsa Brahmās visit the earth in the guise of brahmins and teach men about these bodily signs as forming part of the Vedic teaching so that thereby auspicious men may recognize the Buddha. On his death this knowledge generally vanishes. He defines a Mahāpurisa as one who is great owing to his panidhi, samādāna, ñāna and karunā. A Mahāpurisa can be happy in all conditions of climate. DA.ii.794.<br>Bāvarī had three Mahāpurisalakkhanā; he could touch his forehead with his tongue, he had a mole between his eyebrows (unnā), and his privacies were contained within a sheath.

Rāhula stops and sits under a tree meditating. Sāriputta approaches and suggests that he should develop ānāpānasati. Later in the evening Rāhula asks the Buddha how he can do this. The Buddha describes how it is done by regarding all the elements earth, water, fire, air and space, both personal and external with disgust and loathing of heart. One should not allow sensory impressions to lay hold of one’s heart, just as the earth remains impassive whatever may be thrown upon it. It is so with the other elements. One should grow in loving-kindness, compassion, in gladness over the welfare of others, in equanimity, contemplation of the body’s corruption, perception of the fleeting nature of things, and in the mindfulness which comes from ordered breathing.<br>M.i.420 6; it is perhaps a part of this sutta which is quoted at Mil. 385, 388; see Mil.

'mahāsakuludāyī sutta':['The Buddha visits the hermitage of Sakuludāyī near Rājagaha. Sakuludāyi tells him that the Buddha, unlike other religious teachers, is honoured by his disciples, and gives it as his opinion that this is because the Buddha eats sparingly, is content with any raiment, accepts any alms, is satisfied with any lodging, lives in seclusion, and counsels others to do likewise. The Buddha answers that if the esteem shown him depends on these qualities, he has numerous disciples more austere than himself with regard to these practices, and gives five other qualities which have won for him esteem: he has the higher virtues, outstandingly keen vision, super eminent intellect, he teaches his disciples the Noble Truths, and shows them the way in which to develop the four satipatthāna.<br>He has taught them, besides,<br>the sammā-ppadhāna, the four iddhi-pāda, the five indriyas, the five bala, the seven bojjhaṅgas, the Noble Eightfold Path, (magga) the eight Deliverances (vimokkha), the eight spheres of mastery (abhibhāyatamas), the ten kasināyatanas, the four jhānas, the sixfold abhiññā.

'mahāsaṅghikā':['One of the Buddhist schools which separated out from theTheravādins at the Second Council. The members rejected the Parivāra, the six sections of the Abhidhamma, the Patisambhidamagga, the Niddesa and some portions of the Jātakas (KvuA. p. 4; Dpv.v.32ff).<br>The school was so called owing to the great number of its followers, which made a great assembly or ”Mahāsangitī.” They were counted among the Anātmavādins, and later gave rise to the following schools: the<br>Mahāsanghika Pubbasela Aparasela Rājagiriyā Hemavatas Cetiyavādins Sankantivādins GokulikasOriginally they had only two divisions - theEkabbohārikas and Gokulikas (Rockhill, op. cit., 182ff).<br>Their separation from the orthodox school was brought about by theVajjiputta monks, and was probably due to difference of opinion on the ten points (for these see Vin.ii.294f) held by the Vajjiputta monks. According to Northern sources, however, the split occurred on the five points raised by Mahādeva:<br>(1) An arahant may commit a sin under unconscious temptation; (2) one may be an arahant and unconscious of the fact; (3) an arahant may have doubts on matters of doctrine; (4) one cannot attain arahantship without the help of a teacher; (5) the ”Noble Way” may begin with some such exclamation as ”How sad!” uttered during meditation (J.R A.S. 1910, p. 416; cf. MT 173).

Its mere recital is said to ward off dangers and to bring happiness, and it is the desire of every Buddhist that he shall die with the Satipatthāna Sutta on his lips, or, at least, with the sound of it in his ears.<br>The materials found in the Mahāsatipatthāna Sutta are found also in the Majjhima Nikāya, broken up into two portions, each representing a separate discourse - the Satipatthāna Sutta and the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta.'],

King Vasabha went to the monastery, as the monk lay dying, intending to worship him, but at the door he heard the groans of the ill man, and disgusted that, after sixty years of monastic life, he should not be able to conquer his pain, he did not enter. This was reported to the Elder, and putting forth great effort, he subdued his pain and sent word to the king to come to him.

A wealthy brahmin, looking worn and wearing a coarse garment, visits the Buddha at Sāvatthi and tells him that his four sons, aided by their wives, have shown him the door. The Buddha teaches him several verses illustrating the ingratitude of his sons to be recited in the Santhāgārasālā. He recited these and his sons, who are in the assembly, take him home and look after him. Later he goes to the Buddha and asks him to accept a set of garments which his sons have given him. The Buddha accepts it out of compassion (S.i.175f).<br>The Commentary says that the man had immense wealth in his house, some eighty crores. He found wives for his sons and divided half his wealth among them. His wife died, and his sons, fearful lest he should marry again and they should lose the rest of their patrimony, pet him and look after him, and he gives them all except his wrap.

'mahāsāra jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once minister of Brahmadatta, king of Benares. One day the king went with his queens to the park and the latter took off their ornaments for bathing. A female monkey, watching her opportunity, stole a pearl necklace. On the loss being discovered, the king had every person and every place searched. A rustic, seeing the commotion, took to his heels and was chased and captured by the guards. When questioned, he confessed to having stolen the necklace, thinking that the best way of saving his life, and said he had given it to the Treasurer. The Treasurer said he had given it to the chaplain, the chaplain to the chief musician, the musician to the courtesan. As it was by this time late, the matter was put off till the next day, the alleged accomplices being imprisoned. The Bodhisatta, doubting their words, obtained the king’s leave to investigate the matter. He had the prisoners watched, and knew, from their reported conversations, that they were innocent. He then decided that it had been stolen by a monkey, and gave orders that a number of monkeys should be captured and turned loose again with strings of beads round their necks, wrists, and ankles. The monkey, who had stolen the necklace, on seeing the others with their beads, was filled with jealousy and produced the necklace. The guard frightened her, and so she dropped it, and the Bodhisatta was greatly praised for his wisdom.<br>The story was told in reference to Ananda. Pasenadi’s wives wished for someone to preach to them in the palace. Pasenadi went to the Buddha and from him heard the praises of Chattapānī. Later, he met him and asked him to preach in his harem. But Chattapānī was unwilling, saying that it was the prerogative of the monks. Thereupon the king asked the Buddha to appoint someone, and the Buddha appointed Ananda. One day Ananda found all the women of the palace very dejected, and learnt that the jewel of the king’s turban had been lost and everyone was most distracted. Ananda, therefore, went to the king and asked that each suspect should be given a wisp of straw on a lump of clay and asked to place it somewhere, the idea being that the thief would leave the jewel in one of these lumps. The ruse, however, did not succeed, and orders were then given that a water pot be set in a retired corner of the courtyard behind a screen and that everyone should be asked to wash his hands. When all had washed, the pot was emptied and the jewel found inside it.<br>Ananda is identified with the king of the Jātaka. J.i.381 7.'],

The Elder had just risen from a trance, and, becoming aware of Mahāsena’s desire, he visited him, and was given the porridge and the piece of cloth with a prayer from Mahāsena, ”May I realize the Truth you have seen.” After death, Mahāsena was born as the novice and was called Vanavāsī Tissa.

Soon after, however, he fell under the influence of a monk, named Tissa, and built Jetavanaviharā in the precincts of Mahāvihāra, despite the protests of the monks. Tissa was later expelled from the Order. The king built the Manihīra, Gokanna, Erakāvilla, Kalandagāma, Migagāma, Gangāsenakapabbata, Dhātusenapabbata, Kokavāta, Rūpārāma, and Hulapitthi vihāras and two nunneries Uttara and Abhaya.

The Tathāgata can attend any of the eight assemblies without fear; he knows the various classifications of beings, the birth of beings, the way to Nibbāna; he can read the minds of men and the five destinies which await different beings. He has lived the fourfold higher life being foremost in his practice of asceticism, in loathliness, in scrupulosity, in solitude. No one has surpassed him in the practice of these things. He has discovered, by experimentation, the futility of the claims of those who maintain that purity comes by way of food, or offering, or ritual.

He caused several bands of ruffians to invade the territory of Mahāsīlava at different times. When they were caught and brought before Mahāsīlava, the latter gave them money and sent them away, telling them to act differently in the future. In this way the king of Kosala was easily persuaded by his minister that Mahāsīlava’s kingdom could easily be captured. He therefore set out with an army, and as the people of Mahāsīlava were allowed to offer no resistance, the king and his ministers were captured alive and buried up to their necks in the cemetery. In the night, when jackals approached to eat them, Mahāsīlava fastened his teeth in the neck of the jackal that came to him. The jackal started howling and his companions fled. In his struggles to get free, the jackal loosened the earth round Mahāsīlava, who managed to free himself and then his companions.<br>In the cemetery two Yakkhas were having a dispute about a dead body, and they asked Mahāsīlava to settle it. But he wished first to bathe, and they fetched him water and perfumes and food from the usurper’s table in Benares and also his sword of state. With this he cut the body in half, giving half to each Yakkha, and, with their aid, he entered the usurper’s room where he slept. When the latter showed signs of terror, Mahāsīlava told him of what had happened and granted him forgiveness.

The Buddha knew from the number of pallets outside the cells of Kālakhemaka that many monks were in residence there. He therefore addressed Ananda, telling him of the joys of tranquility and solitude. A monk should dwell apart and concentrate his heart internally and thus develop the four jhānas. He then knows that, whatever his posture, he will be free from evil dispositions; his speech will be free from faults, his thoughts pure. A monk should always search his heart to discover if he has any traffic with pleasures of sense. A disciple should follow his master’s footsteps, not in order to obtain interpretations of canonical law, but solely to hear words which conduce to passionless ness, illumination, Nibbāna (M.iii.109 18).<br>The sutta is also called Ganabheda, because it tends to break up crowds.

'mahāsutasoma jātaka':['Brahmadatta, king of Benares, was much addicted to meat. One uposatha day the meat which had been prepared for him was eaten by dogs, and the cook, unable to buy any more, cut a piece from a human body recently dead and cooked it. Brahmadatta had been aYakkha in a former birth and therefore enjoyed the dish. Having discovered what the meat was, he developed a taste for human flesh, and, in due course, came to having his subjects murdered in order to supply him with food. His crime was discovered and his guilt brought home by his commander in chief, Kālahatthī, but the king refused to give up his cannibalism and was driven out of the kingdom. Kālahatthi relates various stories to the king, showing the folly of his behaviour- e.g., the story of the fish Ananda, of Sujāta’s son, of the geese who lived in Cittakūta and of theUnnābhi spider.<br>The king dwelt in the forests with his cooks, eating all the travelers they were able to seize. The day arrived when he killed the cook himself and ate his flesh. Some time after he fell upon a brahmin traveling through the forest with a large retinue, and they gave chase to the king. As he ran an acacia splinter pierced his foot, causing him great pain. Seeing a banyan tree, he made a vow to bathe its trunk with the blood of one hundred and one princes if his foot were healed in seven days. The foot did heal within that time, and with the assistance of a Yakkha, who had been his friend in a previous birth, he managed to capture one hundred kings whom he hung on the tree by means of cords passed through their hands.<br>The deity of the tree was alarmed and, on the advice ofSakka, appeared before the man eater (who is called in the context Porisāda) and demanded that he should bring Sutasoma, Prince of Kuru, to complete the number of his victims. Sutasoma had been the man eater’s friend and private tutor (pitthācariya) at Takkasilā. Anxious to appease the deity, the man eater went to Sutasoma’s park and there waited for him hidden in the pond, when Sutasoma came to take his ceremonial bath on the festival day of Phussa. On the way to the park, Sutasoma met a brahmin,Nanda, who offered, for four thousand pieces, to teach him four verses learnt from Kassapa Buddha. Sutasoma promised to learn them on his return from the park, but there he was caught by the Porisāda. Promising to return to the Porisāda, Sutasoma obtained leave to keep his appointment with Nanda. This promise fulfilled, Sutasoma returned to the Porisāda and went with him to the banyan tree. There he told the Porisāda of the verses he had learnt from Nanda, reciting them to him, and discoursing on the virtues of Truth. The Porisāda was greatly pleased and offered Sutasoma four boons. Sutasoma chose as his first boon that the Porisāda should live for one hundred years; as his second that the captive kings should be released; as his third, that their kingdoms should be restored; and as his fourth that the Porisāda should give up his cannibalism. Only very reluctantly did the Porisāda agree to the fourth. Sutasoma then took him back to Benares, where he restored to him his kingdom, having first assured the people that the king would never return to his former vicious habits.

For successive periods of eighty four thousand years each he had respectively amused himself as prince, ruled as viceroy, and reigned as king. He one day asked his barber to tell him as soon as he had any grey hairs. When, many years later, the barber found a grey hair, he pulled it out and laid it on the king’s palm as he had been requested. The king had eighty-four thousand years yet to live, but he granted the barber a village yielding one hundred thousand, and, on that very day, gave over the kingdom to his son and renounced the world as though he had seen the King of Death. For eighty four thousand years he lived as a recluse in the Makhādeva-ambavana and was reborn in the Brahma world. Later, he became once more king of Mithilā under the name of Nimi, and in that life, too, he became a recluse.<br>The barber is identified with Ananda and the son with Rāhula.

'makhādeva sutta':['The Buddha visits the Makhādeva ambavana, and, at a certain spot, smiles. In reply to Ananda’s question, he tells him the story of Makhādeva, of how he renounced the world when gray hairs appeared on his head and became a recluse, enjoining on his eldest son to do likewise when the time came. Makhādeva developed the four Brahmavihārā and was reborn in the Brahma world. Eighty four thousand of his descendants, in unbroken succession, followed the tradition set by him; the last of the kings to do this was Nimi, and his virtue having been remarked by the gods of Tāvatimsa, Sakka invited him there. Nimi accepted the invitation, but later returned to earth to rule righteously and to observe the four fast days in each month. Nimi’s son was Kāḷārajanaka, who broke the high tradition and proved the last of the line.<br>Makhādeva’s tradition led only to the Brahma world, but the teachings of the Buddha lead to Enlightenment and Nibbāna.<br>Makhādeva is identified with the Buddha.

During the Akkhakkhāyika famine, Dutthagāmaṇī provided him and four others with a dish of sour millet gruel, which was purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the king’s earrings (Mhv.xxxii.30). Mahādeva took his portion to Sumanakūta and shared it with nine hundred others (Mhv.xxxii.49). He was also among the eight arahants who accepted a meal of pork from Sāliya in his previous birth as a blacksmith (MT.606). He was probably so called because he lived at Kotapabbata in the Malaya country. MT.606 he is called Kotapabbatavāsika.<br>It is said that for three years after his ordination Mahādeva lived in the Maindalārāmaka vihāra (Mahādeva called Maliyadeva in the context (AA.i.22), but further on in the same passage (p.23) he is addressed as Mahādeva). One day, while going for alms in Kallagāma, near by, he was invited by an upāsikā to her dwelling, where she gave him a meal, and, regarding him as a son, invited him to take all his meals at her home. The invitation was accepted, and each day, after the meal, he would return thanks with the words ”May you be happy and free from sorrow” (sukham hotu, dukkhā mucca). At the end of the rainy season he became an arahant, and the chief incumbent of the Vihāra entrusted him with the task of preaching to the assembled people on the Pavāraṇa Day. The young novices informed the upāsikā that her ”son” would preach that day, but she, thinking they were making fun of her, said that not everyone could preach. But they persuaded her to go to the vihāra, and, when the turn of Maliyadeva came, he preached all through the night. At dawn he stopped, and the upāsikā became a sotāpanna.<br>Maliyadeva once preached the Cha Chakka Sutta in the Lohāpāsāda, and sixty monks, who listened to him, became arahants. He also preached the same sutta in the Mahāmandapa, in the Mahāvihāra, at Cetīyapabbata, at Sākyavamsa vihāra, at Kutāli vihāra, at Antara-sobbha, Mutingana, Vātakapabbata, Pācīnaghāraka, Dīghavāpī, Lokandara, and Gamendavāla, and, at each place, sixty monks attained arahantship. At Cittalapabbata he saw a monk of over sixty preparing to bathe at Kuruvakatittha, and asked permission to bathe him. The Elder, discovering from his conversation that he was Maliyadeva, agreed to let him do so, though, he said, no one had ever touched his body during sixty years. Later in the day, the Elder begged Maliyadeva to preach to him, and this he did. Sixty monks, all over sixty, were among the audience, and at the conclusion of the Cha Chakka Sutta they all became arahants. The same thing happened at Tissamahāvihāra, Kalyāni vihāra, Nāgamahāvihara, Kalacchagāma, and at other places, sixty in all (MA.ii.1024f).<br>Malaya Mahādeva was among those various large groups who renounced the world in the company of the Bodhisatta: the Kuddālasamāgama, Mūgapakkha samāgama, Cūlasutasoma samāgama, Ayogharapaṇḍita samāgama and Hatthipāla samāgama (J.iv.490; also vi.30, where Mahāmaliyadeva is called Kālavelavāsī). It is said (Vsm.241) that two monks once asked Malaya Mahādeva for a subject of meditation, and that he gave them the formula of the thirty two parts of the body. Though versed in the three Nikāyas, the monks could not become sotāpannas until they had recited the formula for a period of four months.'],

'mayhaka jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once born in a very wealthy family, and he built an alms hall and gave away generously. He married, and, on the birth of a son, he entrusted wife and child to his younger brother and became an ascetic. When the boy began to grow up, the brother drowned him in the river lest he should claim half the estate. The Bodhisatta saw this with his divine eye and called on his brother, to whom he pointed out the folly of covetousness – “You are like the bird, Mayhaka, who sits on the pipal tree and keeps on crying ’Mine, mine,’ while the other birds eat the fruit.”<br>The story was told in reference to a wealthy man of Sāvatthi, a stranger who settled down there. He neither enjoyed his wealth nor gave it to others, living in poverty, eating rice dust and sour gruel, and travelling in a broken down chariot with a parasol of leaves. He died without issue and his money, passed to the king. When the king told the Buddha of this, the Buddha explained to him that the miser had, in a previous birth, met the Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikhī begging for alms and had sent word to his wife to give the food prepared for himself. This the wife gladly did. But the man saw Tagarasikhī with his bowl full of sweet foods and repented of his generosity. Therefore, in this birth, though possessing much wealth, he never enjoyed it. He was childless because he was the very man who had drowned the Bodhisatta’s son. J.iii.299-303.'],

'māgaṇḍiya':['1. Māgandiya. A brahmin of the Kuru country. He had a very beautiful daughter, called Māgandiyā. Many men of high station sought her hand, but the brahmin did not consider them worthy. The Buddha, one day, became aware that both Māgandiya and his wife were ready for conversion, so he visited their village. Māgandiya saw him, and, noting the auspicious marks on his body, told him of his daughter and begged him to wait till she could be brought. The Buddha said nothing, and Māgandiya went home and returned with his wife and daughter arrayed in all splendours. On arriving, they found the Buddha had gone, but his footprint was visible, and Māgandiya’s wife, skilled in such matters, said that the owner of such a footprint was free from all passion. But Māgandiya paid no attention, and, going a little way, saw the Buddha and offered him his daughter. The Buddha thereupon told them of his past life, his reṇunciation of the world, his conquest of Māra, and the unsuccessful attempts of Māra’s very beautiful daughters to tempt him. Compared with them, Māgandiya was, he said, a corpse, filled with thirty two impurities, an impure vessel painted without; he would not touch her with his foot. At the end of the discourse, Māgandiya and his wife became anāgāmins. DhA.iii.193ff.; SNA.ii.542f.; cp. Dvy.515ff., where the name is given as Mākandika and he is called a parivrājaka. The daughter’s name is given as Anūpamā and the wife’s Sākalī.<br>It is said that they gave their daughter into the charge of her uncle, Culla Māgandiya, retired from the world, and became arahants. DhA.i.202<br>According to the Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.235f), Māgandiya’s village wasKammāsadamma, and the Buddha went there on his journey to Kosambī at the invitation ofGhosita, Kukkuta and Pāvārika. He turned off the main road to visit Māgandiya.<br>See also Māgandiya (2), Māgandiya Sutta, and Māgandiyapañha.<br>2. Māgandiya. A Paribbājaka. The Buddha was once staying in the fire hut of the brahmin Bhāradvājaggotta at Kammāsadamma and Māgandiya came to the hut. Seeing the grass mat on which the Buddha slept at night, he inquired whose it was, and, on being told, he was very annoyed, calling the Buddha a rigid repressionist (bhunahu). Bhāradvāja protested, whereupon Māgandiya offered to repeat his charge to the Buddha’s face. The Buddha, aware of this conversation, entered the hut in the evening and had a discussion with Māgandiya, who ended by joining the Order, later becoming an arahant. M.i.502ff.; Mil.313.<br>Buddhaghosa explains (MA.ii.681) that this Māgandiya was the nephew of Māgandiya (1).'],
'māgaṇḍiya sutta':['1. Māgandiya Sutta. The conversation between Māgandiya and the Buddha after the former had offered the Buddha his daughter in marriage. Māgandiya expresses the view that purity comes from philosophy, from disputations and discussions, learning and. austerities. The Buddha denies this, and says that purity comes from inward peace. The sage (muni) is a confessor of peace and does not indulge in disputes. SN. vs. 835 47.<br>2. Māgandiya Sutta. Records the conversation between the Buddha and the paribbājaka Māgandiya. Māgandiya says the Buddha is a repressionist (bhunahu) and this the Buddha denies, saying that he teaches only the subjugation of the senses, knowing their origin and their cessation; he has discarded all craving after them and dwells with his heart at peace. He then relates how, in his youth, he had enjoyed the greatest and most luxurious kinds of sensuous pleasures and had renounced them. He could no more crave for them than a leper, cured of his disease, craves for his old sores. Both the Buddha and teachers of other persuasions are convinced that health is the greatest boon and Nibbāna the highest bliss. But the Buddha’s conception of health and Nibbāna differs from that of other teachers. Their knowledge is as that of a blind man, taken on trust. Māgandiya listens and is convinced. He enters the Order and becomes an arahant. M.i.501 13; Thomas: op. cit., 115.'],
'māgaṇḍiyā':['Daughter of the brahmin Māgandiya. When the Buddha rejected her father’s offer of marriage with her, her parents joined the Order, giving her in charge of her uncle, Culla Māgandiya. The latter took her to Udena, king of Kosambī, who made her his chief consort, giving her five hundred ladies in waiting. Māgandiyā was incensed against the Buddha for having called her a ”vessel of filth,” and, when he came to Kosambī, she planned her revenge. Having discovered that Udena’s other queen, Sāmāvatī, and her companions were in the habit of watching for the Buddha through windows in the walls of their rooms, she told the king that Sāmāvatī and her friends were conspiring to kill him. For some time the king refused to believe this, but when the holes were shown to him, he had them closed up and the windows built higher.<br>This plan having failed, Māgandiyā hired a slave to revile and abuse the Buddha in the streets. Ananda suggested to the Buddha that they should go elsewhere. The Buddha answered, ”I am like the elephant who has entered the fray, I must endure the darts that come upon me. After seven days the abuse ceased. Māgandiyā then persuaded her uncle to send eight live cocks to the palace and sent a page with them to the king’s drinking place. When the king asked what should be done with them, she suggested that Sāmāvatī and her friends should be asked to cook them for him. This the king agreed to do, but the women refused to deprive an animal of its life. Māgandiyā said they should be tested, and sent word by the page that the cocks were to be cooked for the Buddha. The page was bribed to change the live cocks for dead ones on the way, and Sāmāvatī and her companions then cooked them and sent them to the Buddha. But even then the king, though not knowing of the exchange, would not be convinced of Sāmāvatī’s disloyalty.<br>Māgandiyā then obtained a snake from her uncle with its fangs removed. This she inserted in the shell of the flute which Udena carried about, closing the hole with a bunch of flowers. Udena was in the habit of spending a week in turn with each of his three consorts. When he announced his intention of going to Sāmāvatī, Māgandiyā begged of him not to go, saying she had had a dream and feared for his safety. But the king went and Māgandiyā went with him. As he lay asleep with the lute under his pillow she pulled out the bunch of flowers, and the snake lay coiled on his pillow. Māgandiyā screamed and accused Sāmāvatī of designs on the king’s life. This time Udena believed her, and placing Sāmāvati and her friends in a line one behind the other, he sent for his bow, which could only be strung by one thousand men, and shot an arrow at Sāmāvatī’s breast. But by the power of her goodness the arrow failed to pierce her. Convinced of her innocence, the king pleaded for her forgiveness and gave her a boon. She chose that the Buddha should be invited to come to the palace every day, but the Buddha would not accept the invitation and sent Ananda in his place.<br>Once more Māgandiyā conspired with her uncle against Sāmāvatī. They had all the pillars of Sāmāvatī’s house wrapt in cloth, soaked in oil, and, when she and her women were inside, the house was set fire to. Sāmāvatī saw the flames spreading and exhorted her women to be self possessed, and they attained to various fruits of the Path. Udena questioned Māgandiyā very carefully, and became convinced of her share and that of her uncle in the crime. He then sent for all Māgandiya’s relations saying that he wished to reward them. He buried them waist-deep in the palace grounds and covered them with straw; the straw was then set fire to, and when it was burnt he had their bodies ploughed with an iron plough. Pieces of flesh were ripped from Māgandiyā’s body, fried like cakes in oil, and Māgandiyā was then forced to eat them.<br>DhA.i.201f., 210ff.; UdA.383f.; cf. Dvy., 515ff., where Māgandiyā is called Anūpamā.'],

The Theragāthā contains two sets of verses attributed to him: one (vv. 399 404) spoken on his visit to his home after attaining arahantship when his people tried to lure him back by a great display of hospitality; the other* in connection with a brief sermon preached to him by the Buddha before he became an Arahant.

He won the king’s favor and very loyally helped him to defeat the Vallabha king. He then raised an army with the help of Narasīha, landed in Ceylon, and recovered the kingdom from Dāthopatissa. But later his army deserted him on hearing tidings of Narasīha’s illness and Māna returned once more to Jambudīpa. Some time after he came again to Ceylon with a large army and defeated Hatthadātha, the reigning king, and his general Potthakuttha. In the confusion which followed, Hatthadātha was killed and Potthakuttha was poisoned at Merukandara. Māna thereupon became king and did many acts of merit, including the erection of the Padhānarakkha and the Sirisaṅghabodhi vihāras, also the Sepanni and Siri pāsādas.

'mānābharaṇa':['1. Mānābharaṇa, Mānabhūsana. Nephew of Vijayabāhu I. His father was king of Pandu and his mother, Mittā, was Vijayabāhu’s sister. He had two brothers, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha. He married Ratanāvalī, daughter of Vijayabāhu (Cv.lix.42ff). When Vijayabāhu died, Jayabāhu I. became king and Mānābharaṇa was made viceroy. When the rightful heir, Vikkamabāhu, rose in revolt, Mānābharaṇa seized from him Rohana and Dakkhinadesa and lived in Punkhagāma, under the name of Vīrabāhu (Cv.lxi.21ff). He seems to have lived in constant conflict with Vikkamabāhu. Later, when he had already two daughters, Mittā and Pabhāvatī, he gave over the government to his ministers and retired from the world. But seven or eight months later he had a dream in the temple of Indra and hurried back to Punkhagāma because the dream presaged the birth of a mighty son. This son was Parakkamabāhu I. Cv.lxii.3ff.<br>2. Mānābharaṇa. Son of Sirivallabha and Sugalā. Līlāvatī was his sister (Cv.lxii.2). He married Mittā, daughter of Mānābharaṇa I., and also her sister, Pabhāvatī, and by the latter he had a son, Kittisirimegha (Cv.lxiv. 19, 23, 24). Mānābharaṇa reigned in Rohana as an independent king (Cv.lxvii.95). When the throne was captured by Gajabāhu, Mānābharaṇa tried several times to wrest it from him, but, failing in these attempts, made an alliance with Gajabāhu through the intervention of the monks; later, however, finding Parakkamabāhu growing in power, he went over to him (Cv.lxx.179ff). When Gajabāhu was captured and detained at Pulatthinagara, the soldiers started to pillage the city, despite the orders of Parakkamabāhu. The people were enraged and invited Mānābharaṇa to come. On his arrival at Pulatthipura, he captured Gajabāhu and threw him into a dungeon, seized all the treasures, including the Tooth Relic and Alms bowl, and took counsel with his mother to kill Gajabāhu. On hearing of this, Parakkamabāhu sent his forces against Mānābharaṇa and defeated the latter’s followers at various places. Mānābharaṇa then fled to Rohana, taking with him some of the treasures (Cv.lxx.255ff). From there he again tried to ally himself with Gajabāhu; but the latter did not so desire, though his ministers were in favor of it. Relying on their support, Mānābharaṇa advanced from Rohana. He was, however, severely defeated at Pūnagāma and other places and Parakkamabāhu’s forces assailed him from all sides. The campaign brought varying success to the opposing armies, and Mānābharaṇa proved a skilful warrior. He was helped by various chieftains and fought bitterly and valiantly to the end (for details see Cv.lxxii.148 309), but, as he lay dying, he summoned his children and ministers and counseled them to join Parakkamabāhu. Even after his death his queen Sugalā encouraged intrigues against Parakkamabāhu . Cv.lxxiv.29ff.<br>3. Mānābharaṇa. A general of Māgha, for whose coronation he was responsible. Cv.lxxx.73.<br>4.

'māra':['Generally regarded as the personification of Death, the Evil One, the Tempter (the Buddhist counterpart of the Devil or Principle of Destruction). The legends concerning Māra are, in the books, very involved and defy any attempts at unravelling them. In the latest accounts, mention is made of five Māras<br>Khandha Māra, Kilesa Māra, Abhisaṅkhāra Māra, Maccu Māra and Devaputta Māra as shown in the following quotations: pañcannam pi Mārānam vijayato jino (ThagA.ii.16); sabbāmittehi khandha-kilesā-bhisaṅkhāramaccudeva-puttasankhāte, sabbapaccatthike (ThagA.ii.46); sankhepato vā pañcakilesa-khandhābhi-saṅkhāra-devaputta-maccumāre abhañji, tasmā . . . bhagavā ti vuccati (Vsm.211).<br>Elsewhere, however, Māra is spoken of as one, three, or four. Where Māra is one, the reference is generally either to the kilesas or to Death. Thus:<br>Mārenāti kilesamārena (ItvA.197); Mārassa visaye ti kilesamārassa visaye (ThagA.ii.70); jetvāna maccuno senam vimokkhena anāvaran ti lokattayābhibyāpaṇato diyaddhasahassādi vibhāgato ca vipulattā aññehi avāritum patisedhetum asakkuneyyattā ca maccuno, Mārassa, senam vimokkhena ariyamaggena jetvā (ItvA.198); Mārāsenā ti ettha satte anatthe niyojento māretīti Māro (UdA.325); nihato Māro bodhimūle ti vihato samucchinno kilesamāro bodhirukkhamūle (Netti Cty. 235); vasam Mārassa gacchatīti kilesamārassa ca sattamārassa (?) ca vasam gacchi (Netti, p. 86); tato sukhmnataram Mārabandhanan ti kilesabandhanam pan’ etam tato sukhumataram (SA.iii.82); Māro māro ti maranam pucchati, māradhammo ti maranadhammo (SA.ii.246).It is evidently with this same significance that the term Māra, in the older books, is applied to the whole of the worldly existence, the five khandhas, or the realm of rebirth, as opposed to Nibbāna.<br>Thus Māra is defined:<br>at CNid.

In some cases the three Māras are specified:<br>yathayidam bhikkhave mārabalan ti yathā idam devaputtamāra maccumāra kilesamārānam balam appasaham durabhisambhavam (DA.iii.858); maccuhāyino ti maranamaccu kilesamccu devaputtamaccu hāyino, tividham pi tam maccum hitvā gāmino ti vuttam hoti (SNA.ii.508; cp.

Very occasionally four Māras are mentioned:<br>catunnam Mārānam maṭṭhakam madditvā anuttaram sammāsambodhim abhisamabuddho (MNid. 129); indakhīlopamo catubbidhamāraparavādiganehi akampiyatthena (SNA.i.201); Mārasenam sasenam abhibhuyyāti kilesasenāya anantasenāya ca sasenam anavasittham, catubbidham pi māram abhibhavitvā devaputtamārassā pi hi guṇamārane sahāyabhāvūpagamanato kilesā senā ti vuccanti (ItvA.136). The last quotation seems to indicate that the four Māras are the five Māras less Devaputta Māra.<br>A few particulars are available about Devaputta Māra:<br>Māro ti Vasavattibhūmiyam aññataro dāmarikadevaputto. So hi tam thānam atikkamitukāmam janam yam na sakkoti tam māreti, yam na sakkoti tassa pi maranam icchati, tenā Māro ti vuccati (SNA.i.44); Māro yeva pana sattasankhātāya pajāya adhipatibhāvena idha Pajāpatīti adhippeto. So hi kuhim vasatīti? Paranimmittavasavattidevaloke. Tatra hi Vasavattirājā rajjam kāreti. Māro ekasmim padese attano parisāya issariyam pavattento rajjapaccante dāmarikarājapittto viya vasatī ti vadanti (MA.i.28); so hi Māro opapātiko kāmāvacarissaro, kadāci brahmapārisajjānampi kāye adhimuccitum samattho (Jinālaṅkāra Tīkā, p.217).In view of the many studies of Māra by various scholars, already existing, it might be worth while here, too, to attempt a theory of Māra in Buddhism, based chiefly on the above data. The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean ”the world under the sway of death” (also called Māradheyya - e.g., A.iv.228) and the beings therein. Thence, the kilesas also came to be called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the kilesas were likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a devaputta of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.<br>Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the kilesas, and the world over which Death and the kilesas hold sway. Thus:<br>Those who can restrain the mind and check its propensities can escape the snares of Māra (Dhp. Yamaka, vs. 7). He who delights in objects cognizant to the eye, etc., has gone under Māra’s sway (S.iv.91). He who has attachment is entangled by Māra (S.iii.73). Māra will overthrow him who is unrestrained in his senses, immoderate in his food, idle and weak (Dhp. Yamaka, vs. 8). By attaining the Noble Eightfold Path one can be free from Māra (Dhp. vs. 40). The Samyutta (i. 135) records a conversation between Māra and Vajirā. She has attained arahantship, and tells Māra: ”There is no satta here who can come under your control; there is no being but a mere heap of saṅkhāras (suddhasaṅkhārarapuñja).The later books, especially the Nidānakathā of the Jātaka Commentary (J.i.71ff.; cp. MA.i.384) and the Buddhavamsa Commentary (p. 239f), contain a very lively and detailed description of the temptation of the Buddha by Māra, as the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree immediately before his Enlightenment. These accounts describe how Māra, the devaputta, seeing the Bodhisatta seated, with the firm resolve, of becoming a Buddha, summoned all his forces and advanced against him. These forces extended to a distance of twelve yojanas to the front of the Bodhisatta, twelve to the back, and nine each to the right and to the left. Māra himself, thousand armed, rode on his elephant, Girimekhala, one hundred and fifty leagues in height. His followers assumed various fearsome shapes and were armed with dreadful weapons. At Māra’s approach, all the various Devas, Nāgas and others, who were gathered round the Bodhisatta singing his praises and paying him homage, disappeared in headlong flight. The Bodhisatta was left alone, and he called to his assistance the tenpārami which he had practiced to perfection.<br>Māra’s army is described as being tenfold, and each division of the army is described, in very late accounts (especially in Singhalese books), with great wealth of detail. Each division was faced by the Buddha with one pāramī and was put to flight. Māra’s last weapon was the Cakkāvudha (??). But when he hurled it at the Buddha it stood over him like a canopy of flowers. Still undaunted, Māra challenged the Buddha to show that the seat on which he sat was his by right. Māra’s followers all shouted their evidence that the seat was Māra’s. The Buddha, having no other witness, asked the Earth to bear testimony on his behalf, and the Earth roared in response. Māra and his followers fled in utter rout, and the Devas and others gathered round the Buddha to celebrate his victory. The sun set on the defeat of Māra. This, in brief, is the account of the Buddha’s conquest of Māra, greatly elaborated in later chronicler, and illustrated in countless Buddhist shrines and temples with all the wealth of riotous colour and fanciful imagery that gifted artists could command.<br>That this account of the Buddha’s struggle with Māra is literally true, none but the most ignorant of the Buddhists believe, even at the present day. The Buddhist point of view has been well expressed by Rhys Davids (Article on Buddha in the Ency. Brit.). We are to understand by the attack of Māra’s forces, that all the Buddha’s<br>”old temptations came back upon him with renewed force. For years he had looked at all earthly good through the medium of a philosophy which had taught him that it, without exception, carried within itself the seeds of bitterness and was altogether worthless and impermanent; but now, to his wavering faith, the sweet delights of home and love, the charms of wealth and power, began to show themselves in a different light and glow again with attractive colours. He doubted and agonized in his doubt, but as the sun set, the religious side of his nature had won the victory and seems to have come out even purified from the struggle.”<br>There is no need to ask, as does Thomas, with apparently great suspicion (Thomas, op. cit., 230), whether we can assume that the elaborators of the Māra story were recording ”a subjective experience under the form of an objective reality,” and did they know or think that this was the real psychological experience which the Buddha went through? The living traditions of the Buddhist countries supply the adequate answer, without the aid of the rationalists. The epic nature of the subject gave ample scope for the elaboration so dear to the hearts of the Pāli rhapsodists.<br>The similar story among Jains, as recorded in their commentarial works - e.g., in the Uttarādhyayana Sūtra (ZDMG. vol. 49 (1915), 321ff ) - bears no close parallelism to the Buddhist account, but only a faint resemblance.<br>There is no doubt that the Māra legend had its origin in thePadhāna Sutta. There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjarā, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to Māra’s army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows:<br>the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others. ”Seeing this army on all sides,” says the Buddha, ”I go forth to meet Māra with his equipage (savāhanam). He shall not make me yield ground. That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.” Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.<br>The second part of the Padhāna Sutta (SN. vs. 446f.; cf. S.i.122) is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama, and this the Commentary (SNA.ii.391) definitely tells us. After Māra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, ”like a crow attacking a rock,” he left Gotama in disgust. ”The lute of Māra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence.” This lute, according to the Commentary (SNA.ii.394), was picked up bySakka and given to Pañcasikha. Of this part of the Sutta, more anon.<br>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.124f.; given also at Lal. 490 (378); cp. A.v.46; see also DhA.iii.195f ) also contains a sutta (”Dhītaro” Sutta) in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment. Their names are Tanhā,Arati and Ragā, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra’s army, as given in the Padhāna Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.<br>Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans. Thus the books mention various occasions on which Māra appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.<br>Soon after the Buddha’s first vassa, Māra approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by Māra’s fetters. But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine (Vin.i.22).<br>On another occasion Māra entered into the body ofVetambarī and made him utter heretical doctrines. (S.i.67; cp. DhA.iv.141, where Māra asks the Buddha about the further shore.<br>In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (M.i.326) Māra is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants, of the Brahma world).<br>The Māra Samyutta (S.4) contains several instances of Māra’s temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhakūta fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his hearers (E.g., at Ekasalā; cf. Nigrodha and his fellow Paribbājakas, D.iii.58).<br>Once, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks, Māra came in the guise of a bullock and broke their bowls, which were standing in the air to dry; on another occasion he made a great din so that the minds of the listening monks were distracted. Again, when the Buddha went for alms to Pañcasālā, he entered into the brahmin householders and the Buddha had to return with empty bowl. Māra approached the Buddha on his return and tried to persuade him to try once more; this was, says the Commentary, a ruse, that he might inspire insult and injury in addition to neglect. But the Buddha refused, saying that he would live that day on pīti, like the Abhassara gods. The incident is related at length in SA.i.140f. and DhA.iii.257f.; the Commentaries (e.g., Sp.i.178f.) state that the difficulty experienced by the Buddha and his monks in obtaining food at Verañja was also due to the machinations of Māra.<br>Again, as the Buddha was preaching to the monks on Nibbāna, Māra came in the form of a peasant and interrupted the sermon to ask if anyone had seen his oxen. His desire was to make the cares of the present life break in on the calm and supramuṇḍane atmosphere of the discourse on Nibbāna. On another occasion he tempted the Buddha with the fascination of exercising power that he might rescue those suffering from the cruelty of rulers. Once, at the Sākyan village of Sīlavatī, he approached the monks who were bent on study, in the shape of a very old and holy brahmin, and asked them not to abandon the things of this life, in order to run after matters involving time. In the same village, he tried to frighten Samiddhi away from his meditations. Samiddhi sought the Buddha’s help and went back and won arahantship. (Cp. the story of Nandiya Thera. Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.864) that when Sūrambaṭṭha, after listening to a sermon of the Buddha, had returned home, Māra visited him there in the guise of the Buddha and told him that what he (the Buddha) had preached to him earlier was false. Sūrambaṭṭha, though surprised, could not be shaken in his faith, being a sotāpanna). Māra influenced Godhika to commit suicide and tried to frighten Rāhula in the guise of a huge elephant. (DhA.iv.69f ). In the account of Godhika’s suicide (S.i.122) there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, Māra went about looking for his (Godhika’s) consciousness (patisandhicitta), and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, ”going about like a cloud of smoke.” Later, Māra came to the Buddha, like a little child (khuddadārakavaṇṇī), (SA.i.145) holding a vilva lyre of golden color, and he questioned the Buddha about Godhika. (This probably refers to some dispute which arose among the monks regarding Godhika’s destiny.)<br>The books mention many occasions on which Māra assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunīs, often in lonely spots - e.g., āḷavikā, Kisāgotamī, Somā, Vijayā, Uppalavantnā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā and Khemā. To the same category of temptations belongs a story found in late commentaries (J.i.63): when Gotama was leaving his palace on his journey of Renunciation, Māra, here called Vasavattī, appeared before him and promised him the kingdom and the whole world within seven days if he would but turn back. Māra’s temptations were not confined to monks and nuns; he tempted also lay men and women and tried to lure them from the path of goodness - e.g., in the story of Dhaniya and his wife. (SNA.i.44; see also J.i.231f).<br>Mention is made, especially in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, of several occasions on which Māra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelā, soon after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sāsana was firmly established. Can it be that here we have the word Māra used in the sense of physical death (Maccumāra), and that the occasions referred to were those on which the Buddha felt the desire to die, to pass away utterly, to ”lay down the burden”? Perhaps they were moments of physical fatigue, when he lay at death’s door, for we know (see Gotama) that the six years he spent in austerities made inroads on his health and that he suffered constantly from muscular cramp, digestive disorders and headache. (It is true that in the Mahāsaccaka Sutta (M.i.240ff.), which contains an account of the events leading up to the Enlightenment, there is no mention whatsoever of any temptation by Mara, nor is there any mention of the Bodhi tree. But to argue from this, that such events did not form part of the original story, might be to draw unwarranted inferences from an argumentum e silentio.) At Beluvagāma, shortly before he finally decided to die, we are told (D.ii.99; cp. Dvy. 203) that ”there fell upon him a dire sickness, and sharp pains came upon him even unto death.” But the Buddha conquered the disease by a strong effort of his will because he felt it would not be right for him to die without addressing his followers and taking leave of the Order. Compare with this Māra’s temptation of the Buddha at Maddakucchi (q.v.), when he laid suffering from severe pain after the wounding of his foot by a splinter. It may have been the physical weariness, above referred to, which at first made the Buddha reluctant to take upon himself the great exertions which the propagation of his Dhamma would involve (e.g., Vin.i.4f). We know of other arahants who actually committed suicide in order to escape being worried by physical ills - e.g., Godhika, Vakkali, Channa. When their suicide was reported to the Buddha, he declared them free from all blame.<br>Can it be, further, that with the accounts of Māra, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual devaputta, named Māra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmita Vasavatti deva world? Already in the Anguttara Nikāya, Māra is described (aggo ādhipateyyānam iddhiyā yasasā jalam) as the head of those enjoying bliss in the Kāmāvacara worlds and as a dāmarika devaputta (as mentioned earlier). A.ii.17. Even after the Buddha’s death Māra was regarded as wishing to obstruct good works. Thus, at the enshrinement of the Buddha’s relics in the Mahā Thūpa, Indagutta Thera (by supernatural power) made a parasol of copper to cover the universe, in order that it might ward off the attentions of Māra (Mhv.xxxi.85).<br>Can it be that ancient legends represented him as looking on with disfavour at the activities of the Buddha? Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.533) that Māradevaputta, having dogged the Buddha’s footsteps for seven years, and having found no fault in him, came to him and worshipped him. Is it, then, possible that some of the conversations, which the Buddha is reported to have had with Māra - e.g., in the second part of the Padhāna Sutta (see above) were originally ascribed to a real personage, designated as Māradevaputta, and later confused with the allegorical Māra? This suggestion gains strength from a remark found in the Māratajjaniya Sutta (M.i.333; cp. D.iii.79) uttered by Moggallāna, that he too had once been a Māra, Dūsī by name; Kālā was his sister’s name, and the Māra of the present age was his nephew. In the sutta, Dūsī is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Māra of Gotama’s day. According to the sutta, Māradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men. This suggestion is, at all events, worthy of further investigation. See also Mārakāyikā deva.<br>Māra bears many names in Pāli Literature, chief of them being Kanha, Adhipati, Antaka, Namuci and Pamattabandhu. (MNid.ii.489; for their explanation see MNidA.328; another name of Māra was Pajāpati, MA.i.28). His usual standing epithet is pāpimā, but other words are also used, such as anatthakāma, ahitakāma, and ayogakkhemakāma (E.g., M.i.118).<br>Māra is called Namuci because none can escape him Namucī ti Māro; so hi attano visayā nikkhamitukāme devamanusse na muñcati antarāyam tesam karoti tasma Namucī ti vuccati (SNA.ii.386). In the Mahāsamaya Sutta, Namuci is mentioned among the Asuras as being present in the assembly. D.ii.259; elsewhere in the same sutta (p. 261f.) it is said that when all the devas and others had assembled to hear the Buddha preach, Mara came with his ”swarthy host” and attempted to blind the assembly with thoughts of lust, etc. But the Buddha, seeing him, warned his followers against him and Māra had to depart unsuccessful. At the end of the sutta, four lines are traditionally ascribed to Māra. They express admiration of the Buddha and his followers. In this sutta Māra is described as mahāsena (having a large army).<br>The Commentary explains (DA.ii.689) that Namuci refers to Māradevaputta and accounts for his presence among the Asuras by the fact that he was temperamentally their companion (te pi acchandikā abhabbā, ayam pi tādiso yeva, tasmā dhātuso samsandamāno āgato). Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.133; cp. MNidA. 328) that Māra is so called because he destroys all those who seek to evade him attano visayam atikkamitum patipanne satte māreti ti Māro; he is called Vasavatti (SA.i.158) because he rules all Māro nāma vasavattī sabesam upari vasam vattati.<br>Kālī (Kālā) is the mother of Māra of the present age.

'māthara':['(v.l. Matthara).<br>A parrot belonging to Mahosadha. When Mahosadha wished to find out the plans of Cūlanī Brahmadatta, he sent Māthara to the mynah that lived in Cūlanī’s bedchamber.

He related the stories of Vāsudeva and Jambāvatī and of Vaccha and Rattavatī, to prove that husband and wife need not be equal in birth. Having won her heart and discovered Cūlanī’s secrets, Māthara flew back to Mahosadha (J.vi.418ff). He is identified with Ananda. J.vi.478.'],
'mātuposaka jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once born as an elephant in the Himālaya and looked after his blind mother, who lived near Mount Candorana. One day he met a forester who had lost his way, and, feeling sorry for him, the elephant set him on the right path, carrying him on his back. But the forester was wicked, and, on his return to Benares, told the king about the elephant. The king asked him to fetch the elephant, who, seeing the forester approaching, meekly followed him lest his virtue be impaired. The elephant was received in the city with great pomp and placed in the royal stables as the state elephant, but he would touch no morsel of food. The king enquired into this and learnt of the elephant’s blind mother. Thereupon the elephant was set free, and returned to the Himālaya amid the applause of the people. The king built a town near the elephant’s dwelling, where he showed him great honour, and later, when, at his mother’s death, the elephant went away to the Karandaka monastery to wait on the ascetics there, the king did the same for them.<br>The story was related in reference to a monk who tended his mother. For details see the Sāma Jātaka. Ananda is identified with the king, whose name is given as Vedeha, and Mahāmāyā with the mother-elephant (J.iv.90 5).<br>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.13) calls this the Mātuposaka Nāgarāja Jātaka and gives the name of the elephant as Dhanapāla. It was related to the four sons of a brahmin who waited on their aged father. The audience shed floods of tears, so greatly were they moved, and the brahmin and his sons became sotāpannas.'],
'mātuposaka sutta':['A brahmin of Sāvatthi visits the Buddha and, having told him that he supports his mother with food obtained from begging, asks if his action is worthy.

As a result of this gift she became the queen of Vankanāsikatissa. Later she bought the piece of land for one thousand and built there the vihāra. Gajabāhukagāmaṇī built a stone thūpa connected with it and gave lands to the monks of the vihāra (Mhv.xxxiii.104ff., 115ff). The full name of this vihāra seems to have been Rājamātuvihāra (q.v.).

He asked the Buddha’s permission to dwell there in meditation. Twice the Buddha refused, but, on his third request, let him go. There, however, Meghiya was consumed by evil thoughts and returned to the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him on the five things which make the heart ripe for emancipation good friends, virtuous life, profitable talks, zealous exertion, insight and admonished him.

The brahmins saw him and reported to the king that Mātaṅga was a juggler and a mountebank. The king, therefore, sent messengers to seize him. They found him sitting on a bench eating, and, approaching him from behind, struck him dead with their swords. The gods were enraged, and pouring down hot ashes on the kingdom utterly destroyed it (J.iv.388f; MA.ii.613ff).

Dabba was in charge of the distribution of alms at the ārāma where they stayed, and one day it was their turn to receive alms from a certain householder who had a reputation for providing good food. When, however, the man heard from Dabba that it was the turn of the Mettiyabhummajakā to receive his hospitality, he was much displeased, and ordered his female slave to look after them. The monks were greatly annoyed, and accused Dabba of having slandered them to the householder. They, therefore, persuaded a nun named Mettiyā to go to the Buddha and accuse Dabba of having violated her chastity. The charge was investigated and proved false and the nun expelled from the Order (Vin.ii.76ff.; iii.160ff).<br>On another occasion, these monks persuaded a Licchavi, named Vaddha, who was their patron and friend, to go to the Buddha and charge Dabba with having had relations with his wife.

One day, while descending from Gijjhakūta, the Mettiyabhummajakā monks saw a heifer with a she goat and the idea occurred to them of calling the heifer Dabba and the she goat Mettiyā and then of spreading the story that they had seen Dabba mating with Mettiyā.<br>Vin.iii.166ff.; see also iv. 37f., Dhammapāla mentions a tradition, but contradicts it, that the persecution of Dabba by the Mettiyabhummajakā was so persistent that in the end he committed suicide to escape from it (UdA.431).

The incident regarding the charge brought by Mettiyā seems to have given much trouble to later commentators.

Ananda offers no explanation, but consults the Buddha, who declares that Migasālā is but a foolish, frail, motherly body with none but mother wit; how, then, could she understand the diversity in the person of man? (purisa-puggala-paropariyañāna). The Buddha then goes on to divide men into six classes according to their capabilities and attainments.

'migasira':['1. Migasira Thera. He belonged to a brahmin family of Kosala, and was so called because he was born under the constellation of Migasira.<br>He acquired brahmin culture and practiced the skull spell (chavasīsamanta), by which he could tap with his nail on the skull and declare the destiny of the dead person. Later, he became a Paribbājakā and visited the Buddha at Sāvatthi. The Buddha, having been told of his claims to knowledge, gave to him the skull of an arahant. Migasira tried his art, but had to confess himself beaten. The Buddha thereupon offered to teach him if he would join the Order. Migasira agreed and soon became an arahant.<br>In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a brahmin, and, seeing the Buddha, offered him eight handfuls of kusa grass (? kusattha) (Thag.vss.181f.; ThagA.i.305ff.).<br>He is evidently identical with Kusaṭṭhakadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna. v.l.

J.iii.255f.; cp. Gijjha Jātaka (No. 427).'],
'migāra':['1. Migāra. A setthi of Sāvatthi. His son, Punnavaddhana, marriedVisākhā. He was evidently not as rich as Visākhā’s father, Dhanañjaya, for he drove back, on the plea that he could not afford to feed them, the large retinue who wished to follow Visākhā, to her new home. Migāra was a follower of theNiganthas, and was angry when Visākhā refused to wait on them and pay homage to them when they visited his house. One day, while Migāra was eating and Visākhā was standing by his side fanning him, a monk stopped at their door, and Visākhā stepped aside that Migāra might see him. But Migāra refused to notice the monk, whom, therefore, Visākhā asked to go away, saying that Migāra ate ”stale food” (purāṇam). This greatly annoyed Migāra, and he ordered her to be cast out of the house. But the servants refused to carry out his orders, and he was obliged to agree to Visākhā’s suggestion that the matter should be submitted for arbitration to the eight householders who had accompanied her to enquire into disputes of such a nature. To them, therefore, Migāra recited a list of all his grievances against Visākhā, but she was adjudged quite innocent and threatened to return at once to her father. Migāra begged her to stay, and she agreed on condition that he invited the Buddha and his monks for a meal. He did so, but the Niganthas would not allow him to wait upon the Buddha. At the conclusion of the meal, however, out of politeness, he insisted on listening to the Buddha’s sermon, if only from behind a screen. At the conclusion of the sermon Migāra became a sotāpanna, and, realizing the error of his ways, adopted Visākhā as his mother by sucking her breast. Henceforth Visākhā was called Migāramātā. The next day, again, the Buddha was invited, and Migāra’s wife became a sotāpanna. From that day onwards they kept open house for the Buddha and his monks. As a token of his gratitude, Migāra held a great festival in honour of Visākhā, to which the Buddha and his monks were invited. She was bathed in sixteen pots of perfumed water and presented with a jewelled ornament called Ghanamaṭṭhakapasādhana (DhA.i.387ff.; AA.i.220; MA.i.471f). It is probably this same Migāra whose grandson was called Sālha Migāranattā; but see Migāra (2).<br>2. Migāra. Son of Visākhā and Punnavaddhana. DhA.i.407; AA.i.313 says he was their eldest son.<br>3. Migāra Rohaneyya. A very rich setthi of Sāvatthi. Ugga, Pasenadi’s minister, mentions him during a visit to the Buddha and remarks on his immense wealth. But the Buddha reminds him that Migāra’s treasure is not real treasure in that it is subject to various dangers - fire, water, kings, robbers, enemies and heirs. A.iv.7.<br>The Commentary says (AA.ii.697) that Migāra was called Rohaneyya because he was the grandson of Rohanasetthi. He is probably to be distinguished from Visākhā’s son.<br>4. Migāra. A general of Kassapa I. He built a parivena called after himself and a house for an image of Abhiseka Buddha, for which he also instituted a festival. Cv.xxxix.6, 40.'],
'migāramātupāsāda':['The name given to the monastery erected by Visākhā Migāramātā in the Pubbārāma, to the east of Sāvatthi. It is said (DhA.i.410ff.; SNA.ii.502; UdA.158; DA.iii.860; SA.i.116, etc.) that, one day, when Visākhā had gone to the monastery to hear the Dhamma and afterwards attend on the sick monks and novices, she left in the preaching hall her Mahālatāpasādhana and her servant girl forgot to remove it (this incident is referred to at Vin.iv.161f., as the cause of the institution of a Vinaya rule).<br>Later, on going to fetch it, she found that Ananda had put it away, and Visākhā, being told of this, decided not to wear it again. She had it valued by goldsmiths, who declared that it was worth nine crores and one hundred thousand. She had the ornament put in a cart and sent round for sale. But there was none in Sāvatthi rich enough to buy it, and Visākhā herself bought it back. With the money thus obtained she built the Migāramātupāsāda at the Buddha’s suggestion. The site for the pāsāda on the Pubbārāma cost nine crores, the buildings costing another nine. While the building was being erected, the Buddha went on one of his journeys and, at Visākhā’s request; Moggallāna was left to supervise the work with five hundred other monks. Moggallāna made use of his iddhi powers in order to expedite and facilitate the work. The building had two floors with five hundred rooms in each, the whole structure being surmounted by a pinnacle of solid gold, capable of holding sixty water pots. The work was completed in nine months, and the celebration of its dedication was held on the Buddha’s return. These celebrations lasted for four months and cost a further nine crores. On the last day, Visākhā gave gifts of cloth to the monks, each novice receiving robes worth one thousand. The building was so richly equipped that one of Visākhā’s friends, wishing to spread a small carpet, worth one hundred thousand, wandered all over the building, but could find no place of which it was worthy. Ananda found her weeping in disappointment, and suggested that it should be spread between the foot of the stairs and the spot where the monks washed their feet.<br>During the last twenty years of his life, when the Buddha was living at Sāvatthi, he divided his time between the Anāthapīndikārāma at Jetavana and the Migāramātupāsāda, spending the day in one place and the night in the other and vice versa (SNA.i.336).<br>It is, therefore, to be expected that numerous suttas were preached there; chief among these were the Aggañña, the Utthāna, the Ariyapariyesana, and the Pāsādakampana. See also S.i.77, 190 (= Ud.vi.2); iii.100; v. 216, 222f.; A.i.193f.; ii.183f.; iii.344f.; (cp Thag.vss.689 704); iv. 204f., 255, 265, 269; Ud.ii.9; DhA.iv.142f.; iv.176.<br>It was at Migāramātupāsāda that the Vighāsa Jātaka was preached, and the Buddha gave permission for thePātimokkha to be recited in his absence.

'milakkha tissa thera':['He was a hunter who lived near Gāmendavāla vihāra in Rohana. One day he caught an animal, which he killed and cooked, and then was filled with a great thirst. Looking for water, he came to the vihāra. There he drank ten pots of water, but his thirst was still unquenched, and while he complained bitterly about the absence of water, Cūlapindapātika Tissa Thera heard him and, looking about, saw plenty of water. He then knew that the man’s evil kamma was asserting itself. The Elder poured water on to the man’s hands, but it all dried up. The man, realizing his wickedness, was greatly alarmed, and went and set all the captive animals free and destroyed his traps. He then returned to the monastery and asked to be ordained. His request was granted, and the Elder gave him a formula for meditation. One day, while learning the Devadūta Sutta, Tissa wished to know how fierce were the fires of hell, and his teacher showed him how one spark of the fire could reduce to ashes a whole heap of wood. This induced Tissa to put forth even greater effort, and he spent all his time in meditation living sometimes in Cittalapabbata vihāra and sometimes in Gāmendavāla vihāra with a wet blanket round his head and his feet in water. Then, one day, he heard a novice recite the Arunavatī Sutta and he became an anāgāmin, attaining arahantship in due course (AA.i.21f.; SA.ii.199f).<br>He is quoted as an example of one who strove hard to rid himself of sloth and torpor.

His mother bribed him one full moon day to keep the fast by promising him one thousand. He agreed to do this, and went to the monastery where he slept all night, and then, on his return to the house, refused to eat until he was given the money. Later, he wished to go on a trading voyage, and, when his mother tried to restrain him, he knocked her down. In mid ocean the ship refused to move, and when lots were cast, the lot fell three times on Mittavindaka. He was, therefore, fastened to a raft and cast adrift. The raft was cast up on an island where lived four female spirits of the dead. They passed seven days in bliss and then seven in woe. He lived with them for the seven days of bliss, and when they departed to do their penance, he left them and came to several islands, one after the other, each one greater than the last in prosperity and in its number of women. He then went on the Ussada niraya, which appeared to him as a most beautiful city. There he saw a man supporting on his head a wheel as sharp as a razor, but to Mittavindaka it appeared as a lotus bloom. He asked the man for it, and insisted on getting it in spite of the man’s warning. No sooner had he taken the wheel on his head than he started suffering the torments of hell.

He then became king as Moggallāna III. and was known as Dabba Moggallāna (Cv.xliv.63). He did many good deeds, among them being the construction of the Moggallāna , Pitthigāma and Vatagāma vihāras. He made Sanghatissa’s senāpati ruler of Malaya, but later quarrelled with him and had his hands and feet cut off. The senāpati’s son rose in revolt and killed the king near Sīhagiri. Moggallāna ruled for six years (511-17 A.C.). Cv.xliv.3-62.<br>7. Moggallāna. Son of Lokītā and Kassapa. Loka was his brother. Moggallāna was known by the title of Mahāsāmi (see Cv.

'moggallāna sutta':['1. Moggallāna Sutta.Vangīsa sings the praises of Mahā Moggallāna before the Buddha and a company of five hundred Arahants. S.i.194f.; cf. Thag.1249 51.<br>2. Moggallāna Sutta. Another name for the Pāsādakampana Sutta.<br>3. Moggallāna Sutta.

Moggallāna Sutta.Mahā Moggallāna wonders how many devas have become sotāpannas and are assured of Nibbāna. In order to discover this, he visits Tissa Brahmā, who had once been a monk.

'moggallāni':['See Moggalī.'],
'mogharāja':['Mogharāja asks the Buddha how he should regard the world in order to escape death. The Buddha replies that the world should be regarded as empty (suññato) and one must get rid of the thought of self (attānuditthi) (SN.vss.1116-19; the Buddha’s answer is quoted at Kvu.p.64).<br>It is said (SN.vs.1116; SNA.ii.601f ) that Mogharāja tried twice before to ask the question, once at the conclusion of the preaching of the Ajita Sutta and again at the end of the recitation of the Tissa Metteyya Sutta; but the Buddha, knowing that he was not yet ready for conversion, did not give him an opportunity.'],
'mogharāja thera':['He belonged to a brahmin family and studied under Bāvarī as an ascetic. He was one of the sixteen pupils sent by Bāvarī to the Buddha. When Mogharāja had asked his question of the Buddha and had received the answer, he attained arahantship. He then attained distinction by wearing rough cloth which had been thrown away by caravaners, tailors, and dyers, and the Buddha declared him foremost among wearers of rough clothing (See also A.i.25). Later, through want of care and former kamma, pimples and the like broke out over his body. Judging that his lodging was infected, he spread a couch of straw in the Magadha field and lived there even during the winter. When the Buddha asked him how he fared in the cold, he replied that he was extremely happy (Thag.207f).<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Mogharāja first resolved to win the eminence which was his. In the time of Atthadassī Buddha he was a brahmin teacher, and one day, while teaching his students, he saw the Buddha, and having worshipped him with great solemnity, he uttered six verses in his praise and offered him a gift of honey. Later, after sojourn in the deva worlds, he became a minister of King Katthavāhana, and was sent by him, with one thousand others, to visit Kassapa Buddha. He heard the Buddha preach, entered the order, and lived the life of a monk for twenty thousand years (ThagA.i.181ff.; SN. vs. 1006). The Samyutta Nikāya contains a stanza spoken by Mogharāja and the Buddha’s answer thereto (S.i.23).<br>Buddhaghosa explains (SA.i.49f) that Mogharāja was present during the discussion of Pasuraparibbājaka (q.v.) with Sāriputta. At the end of Sāriputta’s explanation, Mogharāja wished to settle the matter and uttered this stanza.<br>Mogharāja is given as an example of one who attained arahantship by the development of investigation (vimāmsam dhuram katvā) (SA.iii.201).<br>The Apadāna contains two sets of verses in reference to Mogharāja. They seem to be parts of the same Apadāna which have become separated. The first set (Ap.i.87f ) gives an account of the meeting of Mogharāja with Atthadassī Buddha (see above) and includes the verses uttered by Mogharāja in praise of the Buddha. The second set (Ap.ii.486f) contains an account of his meeting with Padumuttara Buddha and the resolves he made before him. It further mentions that, for one thousand years, in a later birth, Mogharāja suffered in hell, and that for five hundred births he suffered from skin diseases. This was because he had lighted a fire in the Buddha’s cloister and had made the floor black. In his last birth, too, he suffered from a kuttharoga and could not sleep at night, hence his name (mogharajjasukham yasmā Mogharājā tato aham). These verses also include the Mogharājamānava pucchā.<br>In the Milinda-Pañha (p. 412) appears a stanza attributed to Mogharāja, but not found in the stanzas mentioned in connection with him either in the Sutta Nipāta or in the Theragāthā. See alsoMogharā-jamānava-pucchā.'],
'moliya phagguṇa thera':['He was always friendly with the nuns and stood up for them in discussions with the monks. This was reported to the Buddha, who sent for him and preached the Kakacūpama Sutta (M.i.122ff).<br>In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.ii.12f) is recorded a discussion between Moliya Phagguṇa and the Buddha, regarding the consciousness sustenance (viññānāhāra). Moliya asks a question as to who feeds on consciousness. The Buddha rejects the question as being wrongly put and similar questions follow, which the Buddha puts in a different form and to which he provides the answers. In another context (S.ii.50), in the same collection, Kāḷārakhattiya is reported as saying to Sāriputta that Moliya Phagguṇa had reverted to the lay life.<br>Buddhaghosa (SA.ii.22; MA.i.315) explains that the man’s name was Phagguṇa and that he was given the title of Moli because he wore a large knot of hair on the top of his head while he was a layman, and that the name persisted after he joined the Order.<br>See also Phagguṇa.'],
'moliyasīvaka':['A Paribbājaka. He once visited the Buddha at Veluvana and questioned him regarding predestiṇation. The Buddha explains to him that suffering arises from various causes -<br>bile, phlegm, wind, bodily humour, change of season, stress of untoward happenings, sudden attacks from without and also from one’s kamma and to say that these are all predestined is to go too far. Sīvaka expresses his approval and declares himself the Buddha’s follower (S.iv.230f.; this Sutta is quoted at Mil. 137). Another conversation he had with the Buddha is recorded in the Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.356). There he asks the Buddha if the claims made with regard to the Dhamma are justified. The Buddha proves to him, by illustration, that they are.<br>Buddhaghosa explains (SA.iii.87) that the Paribbājaka’s name was Sīvaka, his sobriquet being due to his having worn his hair in a topknot.'],

'mora jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once born as a golden peacock and lived on a golden hill in Dandaka. He used to recite one spell in honour of the sun and another in praise of the Buddhas, and thus he was protected from all harm. Khemā, queen of Benares, saw in a dream a golden peacock preaching. She longed for the dream to come true and told it to the king. He made enquiries, and sent hunters to catch the golden peacock, but they failed. Khemā died of grief, and the king, in his anger, inscribed on a golden plate that anyone eating the flesh of the golden peacock would be immortal. His successors, seeing the inscription, sent out hunters, but they, too, failed to catch the Bodhisatta.<br>Six kings in succession failed in this quest. The seventh engaged a hunter who, having watched the Bodhisatta, trained a peahen to cry at the snap of his finger. The hunter laid his snare, went with the peahen and made her cry. Instantly, the golden peacock forgot his spell and was caught in the snare. When he was led before the king and told the reason for his capture, he agreed with the king that his golden colour was owing to good deeds done in the past as king of that very city, and that he was a peacock owing to some sin he had committed. The eating of his flesh could not make anyone young or immortal, seeing that he himself was not immortal. Being asked to prove his words, he had the lake near the city dredged, when the golden chariot in which he used to ride was discovered. The king thereupon paid him great honour and led him back to Dandaka.<br>The story was told to a backsliding monk who was upset by the sight of a woman magnificently attired.<br>Ananda is identified with the king of Benares (J.ii.33 8; the story is alluded to at J.iv.414).

They lived in a delightful land. Another theory connects the name with mora (peacock). The city which they founded had buildings of blue stone, like the neck of the peacock, and the place always resounded with the cries of peacocks. It is said that the Moriyans were originally Sākyan princes of Kapilavatthu, who escaped to the Himālaya regions to save themselves from the attacks of Vidūdabha, and established a city there. Thus Asoka was a kinsman of the Buddha, for Candagutta was the son of the chief queen of the Moriyan king. The king was killed by a neighbouring ruler and the city pillaged.

Sixteen years passed, and the king, leaving the city to quell a border rising, left his wife in the care of the ascetic. The next day the ascetic visited the palace, and having seen the queen, fell instantly in love with her, losing all his iddhi powers. When the king returned he found the ascetic disconsolate, and, on learning the reason, agreed to give him the queen. But he secretly asked the queen, whose name was Mudulakkhanā, to think of some device by which she might save the ascetic’s holiness. Together the ascetic and the queen left the palace and went to a house which the king had given them and which was generally used as a jakes. The queen made the ascetic clean the house and fetch water and do one hundred other things.

The princess then taught her a stanza to be repeated to the prince: ”A soft hand, a well trained elephant and a black rain cloud will give you what you want.” The prince understood, and, one night in the dark fortnight, when his preparations were complete, a heavy shower of rain fell as he waited outside the princess’s window, accompanied by a page boy seated on the king’s elephant. The princess slept in the same room as the king, and realizing that the prince was there, she told the king that she wished to bathe in the rain. The king led her to the window and bade her step outside on to the balcony while he held her hand. As she bathed she held out the other hand to the prince, who removed the bangles from it and placed them on the page’s arm. Then, lifting the boy, he placed him beside her.

He has overcome all obstacles and knows all things. He is as different from a householder as a peacock from a fast flying swan. According to the Commentary (SNA.i.254 t ) the sutta is a composite one made up of stanzas preached on various occasions; thus, the first four verses had reference to a mother and a son who joined the Order, met frequently, and, owing to their affection for each other, fell into sin (Cp. Mātuputtika Sutta). The fifth was in reference to Upaka’s attainment of anāgāmiphala; the sixth to Khadiravaniya Revata; the seventh was preached to Suddhodana to explain why the Buddha had renounced his luxuries. The ninth was in reference to Ciñcā’s attempt to malign the Buddha; the tenth was preached to the daughter of a Sāvatthi setthi. Seeing a weaver’s spindle and reflecting on it, she realized the crookedness of beings and was disgusted with the worldly life. The Buddha, reading her thoughts, appeared before her in a ray of light and preached to her. The eleventh was preached to the seven year old daughter of a weaver of Alavi, who became a sotāpanna and died soon after (See DhA.iii.170ff). The twelfth was preached to the brahmin Pañcaggadāyaka; and the thirteenth was in reference to a treasurer of Sāvatthi who joined the Order and left it three times, on the fourth time of joining he became an arahant.

Sakka’s throne was heated by her piety, and he persuaded the Bodhisatta, then in Tāvatimsa, to be born as her son. The Bodhisatta reluctantly agreed. Great were the rejoicings over his birth. He was called Temiya because on the day of his birth there was a great shower throughout the kingdom and he was born wet. When he was one month old, he was brought to the king, and, as he lay in his lap, he heard grievous sentences passed on some robbers brought before the king. Later, as he lay in bed, Temiya recollected his past births and remembered how he had once reigned for twenty years as king of Benares, and, as a result, had suffered in Ussada niraya for twenty thousand years. Anguish seized him at the thought of having to be king once more, but the goddess of his parasol, who had once been his mother, consoled him by advising him to pretend to be dumb and incapable of any action. He took this advice, and for sixteen years the king and queen, in consultation with the ministers and others, tried every conceivable means of breaking his resolve, knowing him to be normal in body. But all their attempts failed, and at last he was put in a chariot and sent with the royal charioteer, Sunanda, to the charnel ground, where he was to be clubbed to death and buried. At the queen’s urgent request, however, Temiya was appointed to rule over Kāsi for one week before being put to death, but the enjoyment of royal power did not weaken his resolve. The charioteer, under the influence of Sakka, took Temiya to what he considered to be the charnel-ground and there, while Sunanda was digging the grave, Temiya stole up behind him and confided to him his purpose and his resolve to lead the ascetic life. Sunanda was so impressed by Temiya’s words that he immediately wished to become an ascetic himself, but Temiya desired him to inform his parents of what had happened. When the king and queen heard Sunanda’s news, they went with all their retinue to Temiya’s hermitage and there, after hearing Temiya preach, they all became ascetics. The inhabitants of the three kingdoms adjacent to Benares followed their example, and great was the number of ascetics. Sakka and Vissakamma provided shelter for them. The crowds who thus flocked together were called the Mūgapakkha samāgama.

The first two were based on incidents seen by the Bodhisatta – a horse killing the mouse that worried the sore place in his foot and throwing him into the well; and the same horse, later, trying to eat barley by putting its head through the fence; the third was made of his own accord. Later, Yava became king, and his son, when sixteen years old, made three attempts on his life. But they all failed because Yava repeated the stanzas taught him by the Bodhisatta.

The devatā living in the tree was annoyed, and announced to the Thera that the king who looked after him would die in seven days. The Thera mentioned this in the palace; seven days passed and, as nothing happened. The king had the Thera’s hands and feet cut off (VibhA.407). Near the monastery was a village named Kelakacchagāma (c.l. Kālagacchagāma) (MA.ii.1025). Dappula gave the village of Kevattagambhīra to the vihāra (Cv.x1v.58).'],

'nāgapeta vatthu':['In a Brahmin family of Benares, the two sons and the daughter heard the Doctrine from Sankicca Thera and became believers.

Making this his topic of thought, he developed insight into the perishable ness of life and became an arahant (Thag.vs.267 70; ThagA.i.378). Another day (evidently earlier than the previous incident), while walking with the Buddha, they came to a cleft in the road, and the Buddha wished to go along one way, while Nāgasamāla wished to go along another, in spite of the Buddha’s warning that it was dangerous. In the end, he put the Buddha’s begging bowl and robe on the ground and left him. Brigands waylaid him and ill treated him, breaking his bowl and threatening to kill him. Thereupon he turned back to the Buddha and asked his forgiveness (Ud.viii.7; UdA.425f).<br>Nāgasamāla was a householder in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, and, seeing the Buddha walking in the sun, he gave him an umbrella.

The road from Rājagaha to Nālandā passed through Ambalatthikā (D.ii.81; Vin.ii.287), and from Nālandā it went on to Pātaligāma (D.ii.84).

Nālagiri was a fierce animal, and in order to increase his fierceness, Devadatta instructed his keeper to give him twice his usual amount of toddy. Proclamation was made, by the beating of drums, that the streets of the city should be cleared as Nālāgiri would be let loose upon them. When the Buddha was informed of this and warned against going into the city for alms, he ignored the warning, and went into Rājagaha with the monks of the eighteen monasteries of the city. At the sight of Nālāgiri all the people fled in terror.Ananda, seeing the elephant advancing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the Buddha’s orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place. Just then, a woman, carrying a child, saw the elephant coming and fled, in her terror dropping the child at the Buddha’s feet. As the elephant was about to attack the child, the Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, and, stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal’s forehead. Thrilling with joy at the touch, Nālāgiri sank on his knees before the Buddha, and the Buddha taught him the Dhamma.<br>It is said that had the elephant not been a wild beast he would have become asotāpanna. Marvelling at the sight, the assembled populace threw all their ornaments on the elephant’s body, covering it entirely, and henceforth the elephant was known as Dhanapāla (Dhanapālaka). The Buddha returned to Veluvana, and that day, at eventide, preached the Cullahamsa Jātaka in praise of Ananda’s loyalty to himself (Vin.ii.194f.: J.v.333ff.; Avedānas i. 177).<br>It is said (Mil. 349) that nine hundred million living beings, who saw the miracle, realized the Truth.<br>The Bodhisatta, in a past life, was once riding an elephant when he saw a Pacceka Buddha.

Before eating the food, he bathed in the ford calledSuppatittha. Under the bed of the river lay the abode of the Nāga king, Kāla. There was a sāla grove on the banks, where the Buddha spent the afternoon previous to the night of the Enlightenment.<br>Three explanations are given of the name:<br>(1) Its waters are pleasant (nelam jalam assā ti = nelañjalā, the r being substituted for the l); (2) it has blue water (nīla jalāyā ti vattabbe Nerañjarāyā ti vuttam); (3) it is just simply the name of the river.

This lends support to the suggestion that at the time the Culla Niddesa was written the Parāyana Vagga, was a separate anthology, and that the Khaggavisāna Sutta did not belong to any particular group. Similarly with the Mahā Niddesa and the Atthaka Vagga.<br>The comments in the Niddesa seem to have been modelled on exegetical explanations such as are attributed here and there in the Pitakas to Mahā Kaccāna (E.g., Madhupindika Sutta (M.i.110f); also S.iii.9) and to Sāriputta (E.g., Sangitī Sutta, D.iii.207f).<br>There is a tradition (NidA. p.1), which ascribes the authorship of the Niddesa to Sāriputta.

'niganthā':['The name given to the Jains, the followers of Nigantha Nātaputta. Unlike the Acelakas, they wore one garment, a covering in front. But when praised for their modesty, they answered that their reason for wearing a garment was to prevent dust and dirt from falling into their alms dishes. For even dust and dirt are actual individuals and endowed with the principle of life (DhA.iii.489).<br>The chief precepts of the Niganthā are included in the cātuyāmasaṃvara - the fourfold restraint (for their beliefs and practices see Nigantha Nātaputta). The chief centres of the Niganthas, in the time of the Buddha, seem to have been Vesāli (e.g., J.iii.1; M.i.228) and Nālandā (M.i.371), though they had settlements in other important towns, such as Rājagaha (e.g., at Kālasilā, on the slopes of Isigili, M.i.92).<br>The chief patrons of the Buddha’s time were:<br>Sīhasenāpati in Vesāli, Upaligahapati in Nālandā and Vappa the Sakyan in Kapilavatthu (AA.ii.751).The books contain several names besides that of Nātaputta of distinguished members of the Nigantha Order - e.g., Dīgha-Tapassī, and Saccaka, and also of several women, Saccā, Lolā, Avavādakā and Patācārā (J.iii.1).<br>The lay followers of the Niganthas wore white garments (M.ii.244).<br>In the Chalabhijāti classification of Pūrana Kassapa, the Ekasātaka-Niganthas occupied the third rank, the red (A.iii.384). The Buddha condemned the Niganthas as unworthy in ten respects:<br>they were without faith, unrighteous, without fear and shame, they chose wicked men as friends, extolled themselves and disparaged others, were greedy of present gain, obstiṇate, untrustworthy, sinful in their thoughts, and held wrong views (A.v.150). Their fast resembled a herdsman looking after the kine by day, which were restored to their owners at eventide (Ibid., i.205f). The Niganthas were so called because they claimed to be free from all bonds (amhākam ganthanakileso palibujjhanakileso natthi, kilesaganthirahitā mayan ti evam vāditāya laddhanāmavasena Nigantho) (E.g., MA.i.423).<br>The Buddhist books record (M.ii.243f.; D.iii.117, 210) that there was great dissension among the Niganthas after the death of Nātaputta at Pāvā. The Commentaries state (DA.iii.906; MA.ii.831) that Nātaputta, realizing on his death bed the folly and futility of his teaching, wished his followers to accept the Buddha’s teaching In order to bring this about, he taught his doctrine in two different ways to two different pupils, just before his death. To the one he said that his teaching was Nihilism (uccheda), and to the other that it was Eternalism (sassata). As a result, they quarrelled violently among themselves, and the Order broke up.<br>That the Niganthas lasted till, at least, the time of Nāgasena, is admitted (Mil.p.4) by the fact that Milinda, was asked to consult a teacher called Nigantha Nātaputta, who, if at all historical, was probably the direct successor to the teacher of the same name, contemporary with the Buddha.<br>There is evidence in the Jātakas to show that the Nigantha Order was in existence prior to the life of the Buddha. Saccatapāvī, mentioned in the Kunāla Jātaka (J.v.427), is described as a setasamanī, and may well have belonged to the Order of the Svetambaras, while in the Mahābodhi Jātaka (J.v.246) mention is made of a teacher who is identified with Nigantha Nātaputta himself.<br>There seems to have been a settlement of Niganthas in Ceylon from very early times. When Pandukābhaya laid out the city of Anurādhapura, he built also hermitages for several Niganthas - Jotiya, Giri and Kumbhaṇḍa (Mhv.x.97f). These continued to be inhabited even after the establishment of Buddhism in the Island, for we hear of them in the reign of Vattagāmaṇī (circa 44 A.C.). When Vattagāmaṇī pulled down the residence of the Nigantha Giri, because of his disloyalty to the king, he built on its site the Abhayagiri vihāra. (Ibid., xxxiii.42f.)'],

'nigrodha':['1. NigrodhaA Paribbājaka. Once, when he was staying with a large number of colleagues at the Udumbarikārāma nearRājagaha, Sandhāna, on his way to see the Buddha, stopped him and entered into conversation. The Buddha, by his divine ear, hearing their talk, approached them and continued the discussion with Nigrodha; this discussion is recorded in theUdumbarika Sīhanāda Sutta.<br>D.iii.36ff.; this discussion is also referred to in theKassapa Sihanāda Sutta (D.i.175 f.). There Nigrodha is said to have felt great joy, but this is not mentioned in the Udumbarika Sihanāda (see D.iii.57).<br>2. NigrodhaThe Bodhisatta born as the son of a Banker in Rājagaha, later becoming king of Benares. For details see the Nigrodha Jātaka.<br>3. Nigrodha TheraHe belonged to an eminent brahmin family of Sāvatthi. On the day of the dedication of Jetavana, he saw the majesty of the Buddha and entered the Order, becoming an arahant soon after. Eighteen kappas ago, in the time of Piyadassī Buddha, he left great riches and became an ascetic, dwelling in a sāla grove. Once, seeing the Buddha wrapped in samādhi, he built a bower over him, and stood there with clasped hands until the Buddha awoke from his samādhi. Then, at the Buddha’s wish, the Sangha too came to the sāla grove, and in their presence the Buddha predicted the ascetic’s future (ThagA.i.74f; Thag.21).<br>Nigrodha is probably identical with Sālamandapiya of the Apadāna.

J.i.88.<br>6. NigrodhaCommonly known as Nigrodha sāmanera. He was the son of Sumana, the eldest of Bimbisāra’s children, and his mother was Sumanā. When Asoka slew Sumana, his wife, who was with child, fled to a candāla village, where the guardian deity of a nigrodha tree built her a hut. Here she gave birth to her son, whom she named after her benefactor. The chief candāla looked after them. When Nigrodha was seven years old, the TheraMahāvaruṇa ordained him, and he became an arahant in the tonsure hall. One day, while walking near the palace, Asoka saw him and, because of their connection in a past life, was attracted by him. Nigrodha had been one of the three brothers who gave honey to a Pacceka Buddha in a past life (for the story see Asoka and Mhv.v.49ff). Nigrodha had called the Pacceka Buddha a candāla, hence he was born in a candāla village. Asoka invited Nigrodha to the palace and entertained him, and Nigrodha preached to him the Appamāda Vagga. The king was greatly pleased, and offered to give food daily at the palace to thirty two monks in Nigrodha’s name. It was this visit of Nigrodha to Asoka which ultimately resulted in the conversion of the latter to the faith of the Buddha (for details see ibid., 37-72; Dpv.vi.34ff.; vii.12, 31; Sp.i.45ff). It is said (MA.ii.931) that Asoka paid great honour to Nigrodha throughout his life. Three times a day he sent to Nigrodha gifts of robes carried on the backs of elephants, with five hundred measures of perfume and five hundred caskets of garlands. All these Nigrodha would distribute among his colleagues, and most of the monks of Jambudīpa at that time wore robes, which were the gift of Nigrodha.<br>7. NigrodhaCalled Māragiri.

'nigrodha jātaka':['A king, named Magadha, once reigned in Rājagaha. His son married a rich merchant’s daughter, but she, because she was barren, lost favour. Thereupon she pretended to be with child, and when her time drew near, she journeyed to her home with an old nurse who was in the secret. On the way she found a child deserted by its mother, and, greatly rejoicing, she claimed it as her own. The child was the Bodhisatta and was called Nigrodha. His father found for him two companions: Sakhā, son of a merchant, and Pottika, son of a tailor.<br>These three grew up together and were educated in Takkasilā. In the course of their travels, while his companions lay sleeping, Pottika heard a cock say that whoever ate its fat would become king, the flesh of its body commander in chief, and the flesh near its bone’s treasurer. Pottika killed the cock, gave to Nigrodha the fat, to Sākha the flesh of the body, while he himself ate the flesh near the bones. Immediately after, men, in search of a successor to the throne of Benares chose Nigrodha, while the others accompanied him as commander in chief and treasurer. One day Nigrodha, wishing to have his parents near him, sent Pottika to fetch them from Rājagaha. On the way back he called at Sākha’s house, but Sākha, who had a grievance against him for having given the cock’s fat to Nigrodha, insulted him. When Pottika reported this to Nigrodha, he wished to have Sākha killed, but Pottika intervened on his behalf.<br>The story was related in reference to Devadatta’s ingratitude. Sākha is identified with Devadatta and Pottika with Ananda. J.iv.37ff.'],
'nigrodha kappa thera':['He was the preceptor (upajjhāya) of Vangīsa, and together they lived in Aggālava cetiya (S.i.185), where Kappa died. When Vangīsa questioned the Buddha as to the destiny of Kappa, the Buddha’s answer was that he had completely passed away (Thag.vs.1263ff.; SN.vs.343ff). It is said (ThagA.ii.211; SNA.i.346) that Vangīsa was away when Kappa died, and had also seen him sleeping with his hands curled up. This was unlike a khīnāsava, but, in Kappa’s case, it was due to long continued habit. Vangīsa, not knowing this, was assailed with doubts as to his teacher’s attainments. Kappa was a vihāragaruka that is, he attached importance to keeping to his cell. When he came back from his alms rounds, he would enter his cell and not leave it again until evening or the next day. This caused disaffection in Vangīsa’s heart, which the latter quelled by force of reasoning (S.i.186; SA.i.208).<br>In Nigrodhakappa, Kappa was the thera’s personal name, but the prefix Nigrodha was given because he attained arahantship at the foot of a nigrodha (banyan) tree. SNA.i.346; because he dwelt under a banyan, says SA.i.207.'],
'nigrodhamiga jātaka':['(Also called Nigrodha Jātaka.) Once the Bodhisatta was born as king of the deer and was called Nigrodha. With him was the leader of another herd, and he was called Sākha. There was an agreement between these two leaders that, on alternate days, a deer from their herd should offer itself to be killed by the king of Benares. One day the turn fell on a pregnant doe of Sākha’s herd, and when she asked to be allowed to wait until she had brought forth her young she was refused by Sākha. She then appealed to Nigrodha, who took her turn on himself. Immunity had been granted to Nigrodha, and when his act was reported to the king, he came in person to enquire into the matter. On hearing the story, he was greatly moved, and promised immunity both to Nigrodha and the doe. But Nigrodha was not satisfied till the king promised immunity to all living beings. Later, on discovering that the deer, taking advantage of this, were destroying men’s crops, Nigrodha, gave orders to his herd to refrain from doing so.<br>The story was related in reference to the mother of Kumāra Kassapa (q.v.). She had joined the Order under Devadatta not knowing that she was pregnant. On discovering her condition, Devadatta expelled her from the Order. She appealed to the Buddha, who caused an enquiry to be held, and, having been assured of her innocence, he restored her to all honour. When Kumāra Kassapa was born he, too, was admitted to the Order.<br>Devadatta is identified with Sākha, Kumāra Kassapa with the doe’s young one, his mother with the doe, and the king with Ananda.<br>J.i.145ff.; DhA.iii.148f. The story is figured in the Bharhut Stupa (Cunningham: pl. xxv. (1) and xliii. (2). It is given in Mtu. (i.359ff.) with several variations in detail.'],
'nigrodhārāma':['1. NigrodhārāmaA grove near Kapilavatthu, where a residence was provided for the Buddha when he visited the city in the first year after his Enlightenment (MA.i.289). It belonged to a Sākyan named Nigrodha, who gave it to the Order.<br>In order to convince his proud kinsmen of his attainments, the Buddha performed there theYamakapātihāriya, and when, at the conclusion of the miracle’ a shower of rain fell, wetting only those who wished to be wetted, he related to them the Vessantara Jātaka (Vin.i.82; J.i.88f.;vi.479; BuA.22; DhA.iii.163; also Mtu.iii.101, 107, 114,138,141, 179).<br>It was during this visit thatMahāpajāpati Gotamī first asked permission for women to enter the Order. This was refused, and from there the Buddha went on to Vesāli (Vin.ii.253; A.iv.274).<br>The Buddha stayed at the Nigrodhārāma on several other occasions, and several Vinaya rules are mentioned as being first promulgated there (E.g., Vin.iii.235, 244; iv.55, 101, 167, 181, 262, 314). Various Sākyans came to see the Buddha at the Nigrodhārāma, among them, Mahānāma,Godha, Sarakāni, Nandiya and Vappa (S.v.369 78; 395 7, 403 4, 408; A.ii.196; iii.284; iv.220; v. 83, 328, 332, 334).<br>The Buddha himself visited Kāligodhā during his residence there. It was during a discussion with Mahānāma that theCula Dukkhakkhandha Sutta was preached. During one of the Buddha’s residences in Nigrodhārāma, the Sākyans invited him to consecrate their new Mote Hall, which he did by preaching there far into the night and then asking Moggallāna to continue his discourse (S.iv.182ff.; also M.i.353, Sekha Sutta).<br>On another occasion the Buddha is mentioned as having spent a period of convalescence at Nigrodhārāma (A.i.219f ); he was there also when the quarrel broke out between the Sākyans and the Koliyans regarding the water of the Rohinī (SNA.i.357; but see J.v.413, where he is said to have been in Sāvatthi). It seems to have been the Buddha’s custom, when staying at Nigrodhārāma, sometimes to spend the noonday siesta in the Mahāvana near by (E.g., S.iii.91f).<br>Among others mentioned as having stayed at Nigrodhārāma areAnuruddha (DhA.iii.295) andLomasakangiya. M.iii.200; a deva called Candana there taught him the Bhaddekaratta Sutta. Is this Lomasakangīya the same as Lomavangīsa, who is also mentioned (S.v.327) as having lived in Nigrodhārāma?<br>Near Nigrodhārāma was once the site of the dwelling of a hermit (isi) called Kanha. The Buddha, remembering this, once smiled, and, when asked the reason for his smile, related the Kanha Jātaka (J.iv.6).<br>There is a tradition (CypA.1,7; BuA.3) that the Cariyā Pitaka and the Buddhavamsa were preached by the Buddha to Sāriputta during his first stay in Nigrodhārāma. It was probably there that Anuruddha’s sister built, at his request, an assembly hall of two storeys for the Sangha (DhA.iii.295f).<br>Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.906; M.iii.109f ) that Kāla Khemaka, the Sākyan, built a special vihāra near Nigrodhārāma, on one side of the grounds.<br>2.

Okkāka.-A king, ancestor of the Sākyas and the Kolians.<br>In the Ambattha Sutta (D.i.92) it is stated that Okkāka, being fond of his queen and wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished from the kingdom the elder princes by another wife. These princes were named Okkāmukha, Kārakanda, Hatthinika, and Sīnipura.<br>The Mahāvastu (which confuses Iksvāku with his ancestor Sujāta) mentions five sons of Iksvāku: Opura, Ulkāmukha, Karandaka, Hastikasīrsa and Nipura (i.348). See also Rockhill, p.9ff.<br>They lived on the slopes of the Himalaya and, consorting with their sisters and their descendants, formed the Sākyan race. The legend, thus briefly given, is enlarged on with great detail in the Commentaries. According to Buddhaghosa, there are three dynasties with a king named Okkāka at the head of each, all of them lineal descendants of the primeval king, Mahāsammata, and in the line of succession of Makādeva.<br>The Okkāka of the third dynasty had five queens - Bhattā, Cittā, Jantū, Jālinī and Visākhā - each with five hundred female attendants. The eldest queen had four sons - mentioned above - and five daughters - Piyā, Suppiyā, Anandā, Vijitā and Vijitasenā. (The Mtu. calls them Suddhā, Vimalā Vijitā, Jālā and Jālī).<br>When Bhattā died, after the birth of these nine children, the king married another young and beautiful princess and made her the chief queen. Her son was Jantu, and being pleased with him, the king promised her a boon. She claimed the kingdom for her son, and this was the reason for the exile of the elder children (DA.i.258f; SnA.i.352f).<br>The Mahāvamsa (Mhv.ii.12-16) mentions among Okkāka’s descendants, Nipuna, Candimā, Candamukha, Sivisañjaya, Vessantara, Jāli, Sīhavāhana and Sīhassara. The last named had eighty-four thousand descendants, the last of whom was Jayasena. His son Sīhahanu was the grandfather of the Buddha. The Dīpavamsa (iii.41-5) list resembles this very closely.<br>Okkāka had a slave-girl called Disā, who gave birth to a black baby named, accordingly, Kanha. He was the ancestor of the Kanhāyanas, of which race the Ambattha-clan was an offshoot. Later, Kanha became a mighty sage and, by his magic power, won in marriage Maddarūpī, another daughter of Okkāka (D.i.93, 96).<br>According to the Brāhmana-Dhammika Sutta (Sn.p.52ff; AA.ii.737), it was during the time of Okkāka that the brahmins started their practice of slaughtering animals for sacrifice. Till then there had been only three diseases in the world - desire, hunger and old age; but from this time onwards the enraged devas afflicted humans with various kinds of suffering.<br>It is said (DA.i.258) that the name Okkāka was given to the king because when he spoke light issued from his mouth like a torch (kathanakāle ukkā viya mukhato pabhā niccharati).<br>Although the Sanskritised form of the Pāli name is Iksavāku, it is unlikely that Okkāka is identical with the famous Iksavāku of the Purānas, the immediate son of Manu, son of the Sun. The Pāli is evidently more primitive, as is shown by the form Okkāmukha, and the name Iksavāku looks like a deliberate attempt at accommodation to the Purānic account. For discussion see Thomas, op. cit., p.6.<br>According to the Mahāvastu, Iksavāku was the king of the Kosalas and his capital was Sāketa - i.e. Ayodhyā. See also s.v.

'pabbatūpama sutta':['1. Pabbatūpama SuttaPasenadi comes to the Buddha and tells him that he has been much occupied with kingly matters. The Buddha reminds him by means of a parable that old age and death are ceaselessly rolling on upon him, like mighty mountains crushing everything in their way. Against such an advance his counsellors and his armies would be useless, and the king admits that leading the righteous life is the only way (S.i.100f). The Commentary adds (SA.i.131f ) that on the occasion of this visit the king had been attacked by bandits lying in wait for him in the Andhavana. He had, however, been warned, and, having surrounded the wood destroyed the bandits.<br>2. Pabbatūpama SuttaThe dukkha which one Ariyan disciple who has won understanding has destroyed, placed beside the dukkha which remains to be destroyed, would be like the whole Himālaya beside seven grains of gravel the size of mustard seeds.

'pabbatūpatthara jātaka':['Once, Brahmadatta, king of Benares, discovered one of his courtiers intriguing in his harem. But being fond both of the man and the woman concerned, he asked advice of his counselor, the Bodhisatta, in a riddle that a pretty lake at the foot of a hill was being used by a jackal, while the lion lay quiet through it all. The counsellor’s answer was that all creatures drink at will of a mighty river, yet the river is a river for all that.

'pabbhāravāsī tissa thera':['Having received a topic of meditation from the Buddha, he went into the forest. Seeing a cave, he dwelt there, a woman from the neighbouring village supplying him with food. The deity in the cave found the Elder’s presence inconvenient, but could think of no excuse for asking him to go away, his life having been spotless. But after much thinking, she hit upon a plan; she took possession of the body of the youngest son of the woman who supplied the Elder, and wrung his neck, telling the mother that he would be cured if she could get certain things from the Elder as medicine. This the woman refused to do, but, in the end, she consented to throw on the head of her son, with the Elder’s permission, the water used for washing the latter’s feet. When the Elder returned to his cave the deity addressed him as ”physician.” He could not understand this until she had told him the story. Then realizing how blameless his life had been, he was filled with joy and attained arahantship. But because the deity had tried to bring calumny on him, he asked her to leave the forest.

'paccanīka sutta':['Once the brahmin Paccanīkasāta of Sāvatthi visited the Buddha and asked him to recite a doctrine.

'paccanīkasāta':['A brahmin of Sāvatthi, to whom the Buddha refused to preach (see Paccanīa Sutta). Buddhaghosa says (SA.i.205) that the Brahmin was so called (&quot;Gainsayer&quot;) because he took delight in opposing everything that anyone else said.'],
'paccanta sutta':['Few are those born in the Majjhimadesa; more numerous those born in the Paccanta janapada, among unreasoning barbarians. S.v.466.'],
'paccantajanapada':['In the texts contrast is often drawn between the Paccantajanapada and theMajjhimadesa. In the latter the fortunate ones are born, and it is a great disadvantage to be born outside it; for, then, the possibilities of hearing of the Buddha and his teaching become remote (E.g., DhA.iii.248, 489; KhA.133).<br>The boundaries of the Majjhimadesa are given in several places, and the Paccantajanapada, lies beyond these boundaries. They are: in the east,Kajaṅgala andMahāsālā; in the south east, the riverSalalavatī; in the south, Setakannikā; in the west, Thūna; and in the north,Usīraddhaja (pabbata) (Vin.i.197; J.i.49; cp. Dvy.21f).<br>The Vinaya rules were relaxed in the case of those who lived in the Paccantajanapada, where it is said that the Buddha never spent a night. MA.ii.982.'],
'paccarī':['See Mahāpaccarī.'],
'paccaya':['1. Paccaya TheraAn arahant. He belonged to a noble family of Rohī (Rohinī) and succeeded to his father’s estate. Once, when he was holding a ceremonial oblation, a great number of people assembled, and the Buddha, arriving among them, preached from the sky, seated in a jewelled pavilion made for him by Vessavana. Paccaya heard the preaching and renounced the world, attaining arahantship in a few days, and not leaving his cell till he had developed insight.<br>It is said that in the time of Kassapa Buddha, Paccaya was a monk who refused to leave the vihāra till he gained insight, but he died before his purpose was fulfilled. Earlier, ninety one kappas ago, he had come across the Buddha Vipassī, on the banks of the Vinatā, and had offered him a fig (udumbara) (Thag. vss. 222 4; ThagA.i.341f). He is probably identical with Udumbaraphaladāyaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.295.<br>2. PaccayaThe state elephant of Vessantara, brought to the stall by a female flying elephant, on the day of his birth, and deposited there. He was white in colour, and was called Paccaya because he supplied a need of Vemantara. J.vi.485.<br>Paccaya SuttaAn explanation of the teaching regarding Paticcasamuppāda. S.ii.25f.'],
'paccāgamanīya thera':['An arahant. In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a cakkavāka dwelling on the banks of the river Sindhu. One day, seeing the Buddha travelling through the air, the bird offered him a sāla flower in its beak.<br>Seventeen kappas ago he was king eighteen times under the name of Sucārudassana (Ap.i.113).<br>He is probably identical with Punnamāsa Thera. ThagA.i.53f.'],
'pacceka brahmā':['Mention is made in one or two places in the books of Brahmas who are described as Pacceka Brahmā -&nbsp; e.g., Subrahmā, Suddhāvāsa and Tudu. I have not come across any explanation of this term. It may designate a Brahmā who does not live in any recognized Brahmā world, but in a world of his own.'],
'pacceka buddha':['The name given to one who is enlightened by and for himself - i.e., one who has attained to supreme and perfect insight, but who dies without proclaiming the truth to the world - hence the equivalent ”Silent Buddha” sometimes found in translations. Pacceka Buddhas practise their pāramī for at least two thousand asankheyyakappas. They are born in any of the three kulas: brāhmana, khattiya, or gahapati only in a vivattamāna kappa, during which Buddhas are also born, but they never meet a Buddha face to face. They cannot instruct others; their realization of the Dhamma is ”like a dream seen by a deaf mute.” They attain to all the iddhi,samāpatti and patisanhidā of the Buddhas, but are second to the Buddhas in their spiritual development. They do ordain others; their admonition is only in reference to good and proper conduct (abhisamācārikasikkhā).<br>Sometimes (e.g., at J.iv.341) it is stated that a Pacceka Buddha’s knowledge and comprehension of ways and means is less than that of a Bodhisatta. They hold their uposatha in the Ratanamālaka, at the foot of the Mañjūsarukkha in Gandhamādana. It is possible to become a Pacceka Buddha while yet a layman, but, in this case, the marks of a layman immediately disappear. Three caves in the Nandamūlakapabbhāra - Suvannaguhā, Maniguhā and Rajataguhā - are the dwelling places of Pacceka Buddhas. Round the Ratanamālaka, q.v. (or Sabbaratanamālaka), seats are always ready to receive the Pacceka Buddhas. When a Pacceka Buddha appears in the world, he immediately seeks the Ratanamālaka, and there takes his appointed seat. Then all the other Pacceka Buddhas in the world assemble there to meet him, and, in reply to a question by the chief of them, he relates the circumstances which led to his enlightenment. Similarly, all the Pacceka Buddhas assemble at the same spot when one of them is about to die. The dying one takes leave of the others, and, after his death, they cremate his body and his relics disappear. These details are given in SNA.i.47, 51, 58, 63; KhA.178, 199; ApA.i.125; see also s.v. Gandhamādana.<br>But, according to another account, they die on the mountain called Mahāpapāta (q.v.). There does not seem to be any limit to the number of Pacceka Buddhas who could appear simultaneously. In one instance, five hundred are mentioned as so doing, all sons of Padumavatī (q.v.), at the head of whom was Mahāpaduma. In the Isigili Sutta (M.iii.68ff ) appears a long list of Pacceka Buddhas who dwelt on the Isigili Mountain (q.v.), and after whom the mountain was named.<br>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.889ff), the names in this list belonged to the five hundred sons of Padumavatī, but the number of the names is far less than five hundred. This discrepancy is explained by saying that as many as twelve bore the same name. Other names are found scattered over different texts, such as the Jātakaṭṭhakathā. E.g., Darīmukha (J.iii.240), Sonaka (v.249); see also DhA. iv.120, etc.<br>The name occurring most frequently in the texts is that of Tagarasikhī (q.v.). Mention is also made of the Pacceka Buddhas going among men for alms and spending the rainy season in dwellings provided by men. E.g., DhA.ii.112f.; iii.91, 368; iv.200. Their patthanā (SNA.51). Their wisdom less than that of a Bodhisatta (J.iv.341).<br>Among the teachings preserved of the Pacceka Buddhas, the most important is the Khaggavisāna Sutta (q.v.). For the definition of a Pacceka Buddha see Puggalapiññatti (p.14; cf. p.70). There he is described as one who understands the Truth by his own efforts, but does not obtain omniscience nor mastery over the Fruits (phalesu vasībhāvam).<br>See also Mātaṅga (2).'],
'pacchābhumma':['The name given to the district to the west (of theMajjhimadesa) (S.iii.5, 6; SA.ii.186).<br>Mention is also made of the Pacchābhūmaka brahmins, who are carriers of water pots, fire worshippers, and who claim to be able to send a man heavenward after death.

'paccorohanī vagga':['The twelfth section of the Dassaka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya (A.v.222 37). One of the suttas deals with the &quot;spiritual coming down again&quot; (paccorohani); hence, probably the name of the Vagga.'],

'padakusalamānava jātaka':['Once the queen of a Benares king, having sworn a false oath, became a horse faced yakkha. She served Vessavana for three years and was given leave to eat people within a certain range. One day she caught a rich and handsome brahmin, and, falling in love with him, made him her husband. When she went out she shut him up, lest he should escape. The Bodhisatta was born as their son, and, on learning his father’s story, discovered from the yakkha how far her power extended, and then escaped with his father. The yakkha followed, but they were outside her territory and would not be persuaded to return. She gave her son a charm enabling him to trace the footsteps of any person, even after the lapse of twelve years. On the strength of his charm, the lad entered the service of the king of Benares. One day, the king and his chaplain, wishing to test him, stole some treasure, took it away by devious paths, and hid it in a tank. The youth recovered it quite easily, tracing their footsteps even in the air. The king wished the names of the thieves to be divulged, but this the boy would not do. But he related to the king various stories, showing that he knew the real culprits. The king, however, insisted on the thieves being denounced, and when the boy revealed their names, the assembled populace murdered the king and his chaplain and crowned the Bodhisatta as king.<br>The story was related in reference to a seven year old boy of Sāvatthi who could recognize footsteps. His father put him through a severe test, and then went to the Buddha, where the boy found him. When the Buddha heard the story he revealed that of the past. The father of the story of the past is identified with Mahā Kassapa. J.iii.501 14.'],

'padumuttara':['1. PadumuttaraThe tenth of the twenty four Buddhas. He was born in Hamsavatī, of the khattiya Ananda and his wife Sujātā. At the moments of his birth and his Enlightenment, a shower of lotuses fell in the ten thousand worlds, hence his name. He lived as a householder for ten thousand years in three palaces: Naravāhana, Yassa (or Yasavatī) and Vasavatti. His wife was Vasudattā, by whom he had a son, Uttara (according to SNA.i.341, his son was Uparevata). He left home in his palace (Vasavatti), and practised austerities only for seven days. A maiden of Ujjeni, called Rucinandā, gave him milk rice, and the ājīvaka Sumitta gave him grass for his seat. His bodhi tree was a salala, under which he spent a week, and when he touched the ground with his foot, huge lotus flowers sprang out of the earth, covering his body completely with their pollen. (The Samyuttabhānakas give this as the reason for his name.) His first sermon was preached to his cousins Devala and Sujāta, who later became his chief disciples. The spot where the sermon was preached was Mithiluyyāna. Sumana was Padumuttara’s personal attendant, Amitā and Asamā his chief women disciples, Vitinna and Tissa his chief patrons among men, and Hatthā and Vicittā among women. His body was fifty eight cubits high, and his aura spread for twelve yojanas.

'pakkha thera':['An arahant. He was a Sākyan of Devadaha and was called Sammoda, but in his boyhood he suffered from rheumatism (vātaroga) and was crippled for some time; hence he came to be called Pakkha (cripple) even after his recovery. When the Buddha visited his kinsfolk he entered the Order and lived in the forest.

'pakudha kaccāyana':['(Pakudha Kātiyāna, Kakudha Kaccāyana, Kakuda Kātiyāna)<br>Head of one of the six heretical sects of the Buddha’s time. In the Sāmaññaphala Sutta (D.i.56),Ajātassattu is said to have visited him and obtained from him an exposition of his teaching, which was to the effect that the four elements - earth, fire, air, water; pleasure, pain, and the soul - these seven things were eternally existent and unchangeable in their very nature; that there is no volitional activity of consciousness in them. His doctrine is, therefore, one of non action (akiriya vāda). When one, with a sharp sword, cleaves a head in twain, no one is thereby deprived of life, a sword has merely penetrated into the interval between seven elementary substances (cf. the doctrine of the Cartesians, that there is no sin in taking the life of lower animals because they have no soul). In other words, there is no such act as killing, or hearing, or knowing, etc.; no conceptions of, or distinction between, good and bad, knowledge and ignorance, etc.<br>Pakudha’s teachings are also referred to in the Sandaka Sutta (M.i.517), and there described at even greater length, but here his name is not mentioned.<br>Buddhaghosa adds (DA.i.144) that Pakudha avoided the use of cold water, using always hot; when this was not available, he did not wash. If he crossed a stream he would consider this as a sin, and would make expiation by constructing a mound of earth. This is evidence of the ascetic tendency in his teaching on matters of external conduct. His teaching is, however, described as nissirikaladdhi.<br>We are told (M.i.250; ii.4) that Pakudha’s followers did not hold him in high esteem, in contrast to the devotion felt for the Buddha by his followers. Pakudha did not welcome questions, and displayed annoyance and resentment when cross examined. Elsewhere (E.g., M.i.198; S.i.66; SN.p.91) however, he is spoken of as having been highly honoured by the people, a teacher of large and well reputed schools, with numerous followers. But he did not lay claim to perfect enlightenment (S.i.68).<br>Pakudha Kaccāyana’s name is spelt in several ways. Some texts give his personal name as Kakudha, or Kakuda. In the Prasnopanisad (Barus: Prebuddhistic Indian Philosophy, 281; see also Dvy.143; Mtu.i.253, 256, 259; iii.383) mention is made of a Kakuda Kātyāna, a younger contemporary of Pippalāda. There he is called Kabandhin, which name, like Kakuda, means that he had a hump on his neck or shoulder.<br>Buddhaghosa says (DA.i.144; SA.i.102) that Pakudha was his personal name and Kaccāyana that of his gotta. The Kaccāyana (or Kātiyāna, as it is sometimes called) was a brahmin gotta.<br>Pakudha is mentioned as having been, in a past life, one of the five ditthigatikas mentioned in the Mahābodhi Jātaka (J.v.246). He is also mentioned in the Milindapañha as one of the teachers visited by Milinda.

PanditaOne of the four novices invited by the brahmin whose house came later to be known as the Pañcachiddageha (DhA.iv.176ff). In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was known as Mahāduggata. In his last birth his mother was the daughter of a rich merchant of Sāvatthi. During her pregnancy, she had a longing to give to five hundred monks, headed by Sāriputta, the choicest portions of red fish, to don yellow robes, to sit in the outer circle of the monks’ seats, and to partake of the food left over by the monks. This longing was satisfied, and seven times she held similar festivities. When the child was born he was called Pandita because, from the day of his conception, various people of the household who had been stupid or deaf or dumb recovered their faculties. When seven years old, he was filled with the desire to become a monk, and was ordained by Sāriputta, a constant visitor to the house. For seven days his parents held a festival in honour of his ordination. On the eighth day he went, with Sāriputta, into the village for alms; on the way, certain things which he saw - a ditch, arrow makers, carpenters - made him wish to strive for arahantship. Thereupon, with the leave of Sāriputta, he returned to the monastery requesting the Elder to bring him some red fish on his return from the alms round. In the monastery, Sakka stilled all noises and held back the sun and the moon, lest Pandita should be disturbed. The Buddha, seeing this, detained Sāriputta back on his way to the monastery, and engaged him in conversation until Pandita should have succeeded in his effort. After a while, Pandita became an arahant and the whole world rejoiced. Ibid., ii.139ff.<br>3. PanditaA Pacceka Buddha, mentioned in a nominal list.

Pandula’s son, Canda, was given as friend and counsellor to Pandukābhaya. Pandukābhaya married, by force, a maiden named Suvannapālī, and declared war upon his uncles, all of whom, except the eldest, Abhaya, had determined to slay him. With the help of the Yakkhinī Cetiyā, who dwelt in Dhūmarakkhapabbata, Pandukābhaya made all preparations for a final campaign against his uncles.<br>For four years he lived in Dhūmarakkha, and then for seven in Aritthapabbata.

Their country comprised the greater part of the Madura and Tinnevelly, with its capital first at Kolkai and later at Madhurā.<br>Ceylon was inconstant communication with this country, both peaceful and otherwise. Marauding bands of Pandūs often came to Ceylon and, having deposed the rightful sovereign, ruled over the country. Chief among these invasions were the following: (a) for fourteen years, when Vattagāmāni lay in hiding; (b) for twenty seven years, after the death of Mahānāma and until Dhātusena established his authority; (c) in the time of Sena I.; (d) after the death of Mahinda V. They also came with Māgha and Candabhānu, and, later, with āryacakkavattin, who succeeded in carrying the Tooth Relic away to the Pāndyan court; this was later rescued by Parakkamabāhu III. Sometimes the Singhalese kings would make reprisals by invading the Pāndyan territory e.g., in the reign of Sena II., and, perhaps also, under Nissanka Malla. Parakkamabāhu I. sent an army under his general Lankāpura to help the Pāndyan king Parākrama Pāndya against the Cola king, Kulasekhara. This, according to the Mahāvamsa account, brought great joy to the Singhalese.<br>Mention is made in the chronicles of several marriages between members of the Pāndyan and the Singhalese royal families. Vijaya himself took his consort from the Pāndyan king at Madhurā, and later, Mittā, sister of Vijayabāhu I., married a Pāndyan prince who became the grandfather of Parakkamabāhu 1. This led to the establishment of a ”Pāndyan party” in Ceylon which was not always loyal to the reigning monarch e.g., in the case of Vikkamabāhu III. Parakkama Pandu, who deposed Līlāvati, evidently belonged to this party and probably also Vijaya III. The Pāndyan kings claimed descent from the Lunar race.<br>Codrington, op. cit., 15.

At first they refused to pay heed to him, but gradually his powers of persuasion won their hearts and they became his first disciples.<br>It is noteworthy that, although warned by their fathers of the great destiny awaiting Gotama, they were yet reluctant to accept the Buddha’s claim to Enlightenment.<br>J.i.57, 67, 81, 82; DhA.i.87, etc. For details of the members of the group, see under their several names; see also article by Mrs. Rhys Davids in J.R.A.S. for 1927 on them as the ”Unknown co founders of Buddhism,” where she suggests that the members of this group were responsible for certain tendencies in the Buddha’s teaching.'],
'pañcaverabhaya sutta':['Preached at Jetavana to Anāthapindika. The Ariyan disciple is free from the fivefold guilty dread: he knows that he is not guilty of taking life, of theft, of wrong indulgence of the senses, of falsehood, of the use of intoxicants, and he is free from dread of the guilt attaching to these. He is also possessed of unwavering faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and sees the Ariyan truth of the Causal Law. He thus begets confidence regarding his ultimate destiny. S.ii.68ff.'],

He studied in Takkasilā, and, at the end of his course, his teacher gave him a set of five weapons. On the way home he had a conflict with an ogre named Silesaloma, against whom his weapons were of no avail, as they could not penetrate the ogre’s hair.

'pañcāla':['Pañcāla, Pañcālajanapada, Pañcālarattha, PañcālāOne of the sixteen Mahājanapadas (A.i.213; iv.252, etc.). It consisted of two divisions: Uttara Pañcāla and Dakkhina Pañcāla. The river Bhagīrathi formed the boundary between the divisions. According to theKumbhakāra Jātaka, the capital of Uttara Pañcāla was Kampillanagara, where a king named Dummukha once reigned.<br>J.iii.379; also Mtu.iii.26; but the Dvy. (435) calls the capital Hastināpura. According to the Mahābhārata (i.138, 73-4), the capital was Ahicchatra or Chatravatī, while the capital of Daksina-Pañcāla was Kāmpilya.<br>Pañcāla was to the east of the Kuru country, and, in ancient times, there seems to have been a constant struggle between the Kurus and the Pañcālas for the possession of Uttara-Pañcāla. Thus, sometimes, Uttara Pañcāla was included in the Kuru kingdom (E.g., J.v.444; also Mahābhārata i.138), but at other times it formed a part of Kampillarattha (E.g., J.iii.79; v. 21, 289) Kampilla probably being the capital of Dakkhina Pañcāla. So it happened that sometimes the kings of Kampillarattha had their capital in Uttara Pañcāla nagara, while at others the kings of Uttara Pañcāla-nagara had their capital in Kampilla nagara. Cūlanī Brahmadatta is described in theMahā Ummagga Jātaka as king of Pañcāla, with his capital in Kampilla.<br>J.vi.329, 396, etc.; also PvA. 161; see also Uttarādhiyayana Sūtra (SBE. xlv. 57 61) and the Rāmāyana (i.32).

See also Jayaddisa.<br>There seems to have been a chieftain (rājā) of Pañcāla even in the Buddha’s day, for we are told (ThagA.i.331) that Visākha Pañcāliputta (q.v.) was the son of the daughter of the ”Pañcāla rājā.” Pañcāla is generally identified (Law: Geog. of Early Buddhism, p. 19.) with the country to the north and west of Delhi, from the foot of the Himālaya to the river Chambal.<br>Pañcāla VaggaThe fifth section of the Navaka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya.

The Buddha explains. A.i.157f.<br>2. Paribbājaka SuttaThe Buddha visits the Paribbājakārāma on the banks of the Sappinikā and converses with a number of distinguished Paribbājakas - Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī and others. The Buddha tells them that there are four factors of Dhamma which no discerning recluse or brahmin can despise - not-coveting, not malice, right mindfulness, and right concentration. A.ii.31f.'],
'paribbājakā':['The name given to the ascetics and recluses (not otherwise classified) of the Buddha’s time. They were not exclusively brahmin. Their presence seems to have been recognized and respected from earlier times. Generally speaking, their creed is formulated as a belief in perfect bliss after death for the self purged from evil, and as a conviction that this bliss can be won by brahmacariyā, by freedom from all evil in acts, words, aims, and mode of livelihood (See, e.g., M.ii.24).<br>All these four standards of conduct were bodily incorporated in the Buddha’s Noble Eightfold Path, and the last of the four gave to the Ajīvakas their specific name as a separate sect. The Paribbājakas claimed to be identical with the followers of the Buddha in their tenets and teaching (E.g., M.i.64f, 84f), but the Buddha maintained that the two teachings were quite distinct. This is clearly indicated (E.g.,Vin.i.39.) in connection with the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who were Paribbājakas underSañjaya. The goal of the Paribbājakas was deathlessness (amata) which, to them, probably meant birth in the world of Brahmā. Their conversion to the Buddha’s Doctrine followed the recognition that Gotama dealt, not with effects but with causes, and that he went to the root of the matter by teaching how casual states of consciousness arose and how they could be banished for ever. (Chalmers: Further Dialogues i. Introd. xxi. For discussions on the views of the Paribbājakas as compared with those of the Buddha, see also A.iv.35ff., 378; i.215).<br>The Paribbājakas were not ascetics except in so far as they were celibates; some of them were women. They were teachers or sophists who spent eight or nine months of every year wandering from place to place for the purpose of engaging in friendly, conversational discussions on matters of ethics and philosophy, nature lore and mysticism. They differed very much in intelligence, earnestness, and even in honesty. Some of the views discussed in the Brahmajāla Sutta, for instance, and described as those of ”Eel wrigglers” and ”Hair splitters”, were undoubtedly truly thus described. The books mention halls erected for the accommodation of the Paribbājakas, such as those in Mallikā’s park at Sāvatthi (D.i.178), and the Kūtāgārasālā at Vesāli.<br>Sometimes special places were set apart for them in the groves near the settlements, as<br>at Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā lake (Ibid., 111), at the Moranivāpa in Rājagaha (A.v.326), and on the banks of the Sappinikā (Ibid., i.185; ii.175). It was in such places that the Paribbājakas met each other, and in the course of their journeys they would visit each other in order to exchange greetings of courtesy and to engage in profitable discussion. The utmost cordiality seems to have prevailed on these occasions, intercourse and discussions were free, there were no restrictions of creed, caste or pride. Thus<br>Dīghanakha calls on the Buddha (M.i.497), the Buddha on Sakuladāyī (M.ii.29; also A.ii.175ff) and Sarabha (Ibid., i.185). Vekhanassa calls on the Buddha (M.ii.40), as do Timbaruka (S.ii.22), Vacchagotta (Ibid., iii.257), and Sivaka Moliya (Ibid., iv. 230). Potaliputta calls on Samiddhi (M.iii.207), Susīma on Ananda (S.ii.119), and Jambukhādaka on Sāriputta (Ibid., iv. 251). The inhabitants of the towns and villager, near which the Paribbājakas stopped, visited them, both to show their respect and to benefit by their teachings. The names of a considerable number of Paribbājakas, besides those already mentioned, who were well known in the time of the Buddha, are given in the texts (e.g., Annabhāra, Varadhara, etc., A.ii.175), also Sāmandaka (S.iv.26) and the Paribbājikā Sucimukhī (S.iii.238f).

'paritta':['A collection of texts taken from the Khuddaka Pātha, the Anguttara Nikāya, the Majjhima Nikāya and the Sutta Nipāta, and recited on special occasions to ward off illness and danger. The word ”paritta” means protection. The Milinda-Pañha (p.150f) gives a list of the chief Parittas:<br>Ratana Sutta (Sn 222-238), Khandha-paritta, Mora paritta, Dhajagga paritta, Atānātiya paritta Angulimāla (for particulars of these see s.v.; also Dial.iii.185).<br>To these are generally added, in the extant collection of Parittas,<br>the Maṅgala Sutta and the Metta Sutta. The word paritta first occurs in the Culla Vagga (Vin.ii.110) in connection with the Khandha-paritta, which was allowed by the Buddha as a watch, a guard, a protection for oneself, for the use of the Order. The occasion of the delivery of this general injunction was the death of a monk from snake bite. The Milinda-Pañha states (see above) that the recital of the Paritta had the Buddha’s express sanction.<br>The collection of Parittas is, to this day, more widely known by the laity of Burma and Ceylon than any other Pāli book, and is generally used in times of danger or of sickness, both individual and national. Thus, Sena II., king of Ceylon, made the community of monks recite the Paritta, and by sprinkling the water charmed with Paritta he made the people free from illness, and so removed the danger of plague from the country.<br>He also decreed that this practice should continue every year (Cv.li.80).<br>Kassapa V. is said to have had a Paritta ceremony performed by the three fraternities of monks to protect his people from danger and plague and bad harvest (Ibid., lii.80).<br>In the recent (1935) epidemic of malaria in Ceylon, monks were taken in carts through the badly affected areas reciting the Paritta and sprinkling water. The ceremony is held on most diverse occasions such as the inauguration of a new house, the starting of a journey, of a new business, etc. For a discussion on the Paritta see Dial.iii.180 ff.; also P.L.C.75f.<br>Bode says (Op. cit., 4) that in the days of King Anorata of Burma corrupt and cynical monks used the recital of the Paritta as an easy means of clearing man’s guilty conscience from all wrong doing, even from matricide.<br>Buddhaghosa is mentioned (Cv.xxxvii.226) as having once attempted to compile a Parittaṭṭhakathā. Geiger (Cv. Trs.i.24, 3) calls this a commentary on the Paritta, but it is more probable that paritta is here used as an adjective, meaning short, concise, and that what is meant is a short or concise commentary on the Pitakas.'],

'pasenadi':['King of Kosala and contemporary of theBuddha. He was the son of Mahā Kosala, and was educated at Takkasilā where, among his companions, were the Licchavi Mahāli and the Malla prince Bandhula. On his return home his father was so pleased with his proficiency in the various arts that he forthwith made him king. (DhA.i.338; for his genealogy see Beal: Records ii.2, n. 3).<br>As ruler, Pasenadi gave himself wholeheartedly to his administrative duties (*2) and valued the companionship of wise and good men (*3). Quite early in the Buddha’s ministry, (*4) Pasenadi became his follower and close friend, and his devotion to the Buddha lasted till his death.<br>(*2) E.g., S.i.74, 100; the Commentary (SA i.109f.) adds that the king tried to put down bribery and corruption in his court, but his attempt does not appear to have been very successful.<br>(*3) Thus he showed his favour to Pokkharasādi and Cankī, by giving them, respectively, the villages of Ukkatthā andOpasāda free of all taxes. It is said that his alms halls were always open to everyone desiring food or drink (Ud.ii.6). Even after becoming the Buddha’s follower, he did not omit to salute holy men of other persuasions (Ud.vi.2).<br>(*4) According to Tibetan sources, Pasenadi’s conversion was in the second year of the Buddha’s ministry (Rockhill, p.49). We find the king referring to the Buddha, at their first meeting, as being young in years (S.i.69). Their first meeting and conversation, which ended in Pasenadi’s declaring himself an adherent of the Buddha, are recorded in the Dahara Sutta.<br>But Pasenadi’s conversion did not prevent him from extending his favour, with true Indian toleration, to the members of other religious orders. Mention is even made of a great animal sacrifice which he once prepared, but which he abandoned on the advice of the Buddha, whom he sought at Mallika’s suggestion (*5). He frequently visited the Buddha and discussed various matters with him (*6). The whole of the Third Samyutta (Kosala Saipyutta), consisting of twenty five anecdotes, each with a moral bias, is devoted to him. The topics discussed are many and varied. The Buddha and Pasenadi were equals in age, and their talks were, therefore, intimate and frank (*7).<br>(*5) S.i.75; for details see the Mahāsupina and Lohakumbhi Jātakas. It is said (SA.i.111) that the king fell in love with a woman while riding round the city; on discovering that she was married, he ordered her husband to go, before sunset, and fetch clay and lilies from a pond one hundred leagues away. When the man had gone, the king ordered the gatekeepers to shut the gates early and not on any account to open them. The husband returned in the evening, and finding the gates shut, went to Jetavana, to seek protection from the king’s wrath. The king spent a sleepless night owing to his passion and had bad dreams. When the brahmins were consulted they advised a great animal sacrifice. The story is also found at DhA.ii.1ff., with several variations in detail.<br>(*6) It is said that he went three times a day to wait on the Buddha, sometimes with only a small bodyguard. Some robbers, knowing this, arranged an ambush in the Andhavana. But the king discovered the plot, of which he made short work.<br>(*7) Pasenadi was extremely attached to the Buddha, and the books describe how, when he saw the Buddha, he bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, covering them with kisses and stroking them (M.ii.120). The Chinese records say (Beal,xliv) that when the Buddha went to Tāvatimsa, Pasenadi made an image of the Buddha in sandalwood, to which he paid honour. He was very jealous of the Buddha’s reputation, and put down with a firm hand any attempt on the part of heretics to bring discredit on him - e.g., in the case ofSundarī Nandā. In theAggañña Sutta (D.iii.83f.), the Buddha explains why Pasenadi honours him. For Pasenadi’s own explanation as to why people honoured the Buddha even more than the king, see M.ii.123; see also A.v.65 ff. Pasenadi was also jealous of the reputation of the Order, and if anything arose which seemed likely to bring discredit on it, he took prompt steps to have the matter remedied - e.g., in the case ofKundadhāna andKumāra Kassapa’s mother. Pasenadi’s palace overlooked the Aciravati, and when he once saw some monks sporting in the river in an unseemingly way, he made sure that the Buddha knew of it (Vin.iv.112). The story of the blind man and the elephant shows that he was anxious to justify the Buddha’s teaching as against that of other sects (SNA.ii.529).<br>On one occasion we find the Buddha telling him to eat less and teaching his nephew Sudassana (or Uttara) a verse on the advantages of moderation, to be repeated to the king whenever he sat down to a meal. This advice was followed and the king became slim.<br>S.i.81; DhA.iii.264f.; iv.6f.; the Samyutta Commentary (SA.i.136) states that the bowl out of which he ate (paribhogapāti) was the size of a cartwheel. Pasenadi was always conscious of his own dignity - e.g., the incident with Chattapāni; but see Vin.iv.157f., which probably refers to the same story.<br>Pasenadi’s chief consort was Mallikā, daughter of a garland maker (seeMallikā for details of her marriage with the king). He loved her dearly and trusted her judgment in all things. When in difficulty he consulted her, realizing that her wisdom was greater than his own (E.g., in the Asadisadāna). There is an account given (S.i.74) of Pasenadi seeking a confession from her that she loved him more than her own soul (attā) as a confirmation of their mutual trust. But the queen was pious and saw into the reality of things, and declared that nothing was dearer to her than her own soul. Piqued by this answer, Pasenadi sought the Buddha, who comforted him by explaining the true import of Mallikā’s words. On another occasion, Pasenadi expressed to the Buddha his disappointment that Mallikā should have borne him a daughter instead of a son; but the Buddha pointed out to him that there was much, after all, to be said for daughters (S.i.83).<br>Mallikā predeceased Pasenadi (A.iii.57); he had also other wives, one of them being the sister of Bimbisāra, (*14) and another Ubbirī. TheKannakatthala Sutta (M.ii.125) mentions two others who were sisters: Somā andSakulā. (*16)<br>(*14) DhA.i.385; Pasenadi’s relations with Bimbisāra were very cordial. Bimbisāra had five millionaires in his kingdom - Jotiya, Jatila,Mendaka, Punnaka and Kākavaliya - while Pasenadi had none. Pasenadi therefore visited Bimbisāra and asked for one to be transferred to him. Bimbisāra gave him Dhanañjaya, Mendaka’s son, and Pasenadi settled him in Sāketa (DhA.i.385ff).<br>(*16) In the Samyutta Nikāya (v. 351), the king’s chamberlains,Isidatta and Purāna, speak of his harem. When he went riding in the park he took with him his favourite and lovely wives on elephants, one before and one behind. They were sweetly scented - ”like caskets of scent” - and their hands were soft to the touch.<br>It is stated that Pasenadi wished to associate himself with the Buddha’s family so that their relationship might be even closer. For seven days he had given alms to the Buddha and one thousand monks, and on the seventh day he asked the Buddha to take his meals regularly at the palace with five hundred monks; but the Buddha refused the request and appointed Ananda to take his place. Ananda came daily with five hundred others, but the king was too busy to look after them, and the monks, feeling neglected, failed to come any more, only Ananda keeping to his undertaking. When the king became aware of this he was greatly upset, and determined to win the confidence of the monks by marrying a kinswoman of the Buddha. He therefore sent messages to the Sākiyan chiefs, who were his vassals, asking for the hand of one of their daughters. The Sākiyans discussed the proposition in their Mote-Hall, and held it beneath the dignity of their clan to accede to it. But, unwilling to incur the wrath of their overlord, they sent him Vāsabhakhattiyā, daughter of Mahānāma and of a slave woman, Nāgamundā. By her, Pasenadi had a son Vidūdabha. When the latter visited Kapilavatthu, he heard by chance of the fraud that had been practised on his father and vowed vengeance. When he came to the throne, he invaded the Sākiyan territory and killed a large number of the clan without distinction of age or sex (DhA.i.339ff.; J.i.133f.; iv.144ff). It is said that when Pasenadi heard of the antecedents of Vāsabhakhattiyā, he withdrew the royal honours, which had been bestowed on her and her son and reduced them to the condition of slaves. But the Buddha, hearing of this, related to Pasenadi the Katthahārika Jātaka, and made him restore the royal honours to the mother and her son.<br>Mention is made of another son of Pasenadi, named Brahmadatta, who entered the Order and became an arahant.<br>ThagA.i.460; the Dulva says that Jeta, owner ofJetavana, was also Pasenadi’s son (Rockhill, p.48).<br>Pasenadi’s sister, Kosaladevī, was married to Bimbisāra.Mahākosala gave her a village inKāsi as part of her dowry, for her bath money. When Ajātasattu killed Bimbisāra, Kosaladevī died of grief, and Pasenadi confiscated the Kāsi village, saying that no patricide should own a village which was his by right of inheritance. Angered at this, Ajātasattu declared war upon his aged uncle. At first, victory lay with Ajātasattu, but Pasenadi had spies who reported to him a plan of attack suggested by the Thera Dhanuggaha Tissa, in the course of a conversation with his colleagueMantidatta, and in the fourth campaign Pasenadi took Ajātasattu prisoner, and refused to release him until he renounced his claim to the throne. Upon his reṇunciation, Pasenadi not only gave him his daughter Vajirā in marriage, but conferred on her, as a wedding gift, the very village in dispute (J.ii.237, 403; iv.342f).<br>Three years later, Vidūdabha revolted against his father. In this he was helped by the commander in chief,Dīghakārāyana, nephew ofBandhula. Bandhula, chief of the Mallas, disgusted with the treachery of his own people, had sought refuge with his former classmate, Pasenadi, in Sāvatthi. Bandhula’s wife, Mallikā, bore him thirty two sons, brave and learned. Pasenadi, having listened to the tales of his corrupt ministers, contrived to have Bandhula and all his sons killed while they were away quelling a frontier rebellion. Bandhula’s wife was a devout follower of the Buddha’s faith, and showed no resentment against the king for this act of treachery. This moved the king’s heart, and he made all possible amends. But Dīghakārāyana never forgave him, and once when Pasenadi was on a visit to the Buddha at Medatalumpa (Ulumpa), leaving the royal insignia with his commander in chief, Dīghakārāyana took advantage of this opportunity, withdrew the king’s bodyguard, leaving behind only one single horse and one woman servant, hurried back to the capital and crowned Vidūdabha king. When Pasenadi heard of this, he hurried on to Rājagaha to enlist Ajātasattu’s support; but as it was late, the city gates were closed. Exhausted by his journey, he lay down in a hall outside the city, where he died during the night.<br>When Ajātasattu heard the news, he performed the funeral rites over the king’s body with great pomp. He wished to march at once against Vidūdabha, but desisted on the advice of his ministers (M.ii.118; MA.ii.753ff.; DhA.i.353ff.; J.iv.150ff).<br>Pasenadi had a sister, Sumanā, who was present at his first interview with the Buddha and decided to enter the Order, but she delayed doing so as she then had to nurse their aged grandmother. Pasenadi was very fond of his grandmother, and was filled with grief when she died in her one hundred and twentieth year. After her death, Sumanā became a nun and attained arahantship (ThigA.22; S.i.97; A.iii.32). The old lady’s possessions were given over to the monks, the Buddha giving special permission for them to be accepted (Vin.ii.169).<br>Among the king’s most valued possessions was the elephantSeta (A.iii.345); he had two other elephants,Bhadderaka (or Pāveyyaka) (DhA.iv.25) andPundarīka (Ibid., ii.1). Mention is also made (J.iii.134f ) of a pet heron which lived in the palace and conveyed messages. Tradition says (SA.i.115; J.i.382ff ) that Pasenadi had in his possession the octagoṇal gem which Sakka had given to Kusa. He valued it greatly, using it as his turban jewel, and was greatly upset when it was reported lost; it was, however, recovered with the help and advice of Ananda. The Jātaka Commentary records that Pasenadi built a monastery in front of Jetavana. It was called the Rājakārāma, and the Buddha sometimes stayed there (J.ii.15). According toHiouen Thsang, Pasenadi also built a monastery for Pajāpati Gotamī (Beal, Records ii.2).<br>Pasenadi’s chaplain, Aggidatta had originally been Mahākosala’s chaplain. Pasenadi therefore paid him great respect. This inconvenienced Aggidatta, and he gave his wealth to the poor and renounced the world.<br>DhA.iii.241ff.; SNA. (580) says that Bāvarī was Mahākosala’s chaplain and Pasenadi studied under him. When Pasenadi came to the throne, Bāvarī declared his wish to leave the world. The king tried to prevent him but failed; he did, however, persuade Bāvarī to live in the royal park. Bāvarī, after staying there for some time, found life in a city uncongenial. The king thereupon detailed two of his ministers to establish a suitable hermitage for Bāvarī.<br>Pasenadi’s minister, Santati, who was once allowed to reign for a week in the king’s place as reward for having quelled a frontier dispute, gave his wealth to the poor and renounced the world likeAggidatta (DhA.iii.28ff). The king was always ready to pay honour to those who had won the praise of the Buddha, as in the case of Kānā (Ibid., ii.150ff), Culla Eka Sātaka (Ibid., iii.2ff ) or Angulimālā (M.ii.100); on the other hand, he did not hesitate to show his disapproval of those who disregarded the Buddha’s teaching - e.g., Upananda (S.i.153f).<br>Pasenadi liked to be the foremost in gifts to the Buddha and his Order. This was why he held the Asadisadāna under the guidance and inspiration of Mallikā; but he was hurt when the Buddha’s sermon of thanksgiving did not seem to him commensurate with the vast amount (fourteen crores) which he had spent. The Buddha then explained to him that this lack of enthusiasm was out of consideration for the king’s minister Kāla. When the king learned that Kāla disapproved of the lavish way in which money had been spent at the almsgiving, he banished him from the court, while he allowed the ministerJunha, who had furthered the almsgiving, to rule over the kingdom for seven days (DhA.iii.188ff).<br>Pasenadi seems to have enjoyed discussions on topics connected with the Dhamma. Reference has already been made to the Kosala Samyutta, which records several conversations which he held with the Buddha when visiting him in Sāvatthi; even when Pasenadi was engaged in affairs of state in other parts of the kingdom, he would visit the Buddha and engage him in conversation if he was anywhere in the neighbourhood. Two such conversations are recorded in the Dhammacetiya Sutta (q.v.) and the Kannakatthala Sutta (q.v.). If the Buddha was not available, he would seek a disciple. Thus the Bāhitika Sutta (q.v.) records a discussion between Pasenadi and Ananda on the banks of the Aciravatī. Once when Pasenadi was in Toranavatthu, midway betweenSāketa and Sāvatthi, he heard that Khemā Therī was there, and went at once to visit and talk to her (S.iv.374ff). Rhys Davids thinks (Buddhist India, p.10) that Pasenadi was evidently an official title (*38) and that the king’s personal name was Agnidatta. He bases this surmise on the fact that in the Divyāvadāna (p. 620) the king who gave Ukkatthā to Pokkarasādi is called Agnidatta, while in the Digha Nikāya (i.87) he is called Pasenadi, and that Pasenadi is used, as a designation for several kings (*39). The evidence is, however, insufficient for any definite conclusion to be drawn.<br>(*38) The UdA. (104) explains Pasenadi as ”paccantam parasenam jinātī ti = Pasenadi.” According to Tibetan sources he was so called because the whole country was illuminated at the time of his birth (Rockhill, p.16).<br>(*39) E.g., in Dvy. 369, for a king of Magadha and again in the Kathāsaritsāgara i.268, 298.<br>According to the Anāgatavamsa (J.P.T.S. 1886, p. 37), Pasenadi is a Bodhisatta. He will be the fourth future Buddha.<br>The Sutta Vibhaṅga (Vin.iv.298) mentions a Cittāgāra (? Art Gallery) which belonged to him.'],

Pasūra, followed by a large crowd, went to Sāriputta’s lodgings and had a discussion with him, in which he suffered defeat (cf. Patācārā). Later, he joined the Order under Lāludāyī, whom he defeated in discussion, and having returned in his monk’s robes to the dwelling of the heretics, he started off in these same robes to visit the Buddha and hold a discussion with him. But as he entered Jetavana, the deity presiding over the gate made him dumb, and he had to sit before the Buddha, unable to utter a single word in answer to his questions. The Buddha thereupon preached the Pasūra Sutta (see below) before the assembled people. SNA.ii.538ff.<br>Pasūra SuttaThe eighth sutta of the Atthaka Vagga of the Sutta Nipāta.

A description of the route taken by them is also given. The sixteen suttas give the questions asked by Bāvarī’s disciples and the answers given by the Buddha. TheCulla Nidesa comments on the sixteen suttas, but makes no mention of the Vatthugāthā.

The devas eagerly watch each stage of development of leaf and flower, and each stage is marked by great rejoicings (A.iv.117f).<br>When the flowers are fully open they shine like the morning sun. They are never plucked; a wind arises and sweeps away the faded flowers and scatters fresh ones on the seats of Sakka and the other gods of Tāvatimsa. The bodies of the devas are completely covered with the sweetly scented pollen, making them resemble golden caskets. The ceremony of playing with the flowers lasts four months (AA.ii.730f).<br>The Pāricchattaka is one of the seven trees which last throughout the kappa (AA.i.264).<br>The Pāricchattaka is generally described as a Kovilāra (E.g., VvA. 174).

The Buddha then proceeds to give in detail the qualities of the perfect teacher and the perfect teaching. The Tathāgata is such a teacher and the Dhamma such a teaching (D.iii.117 41).<br>In the Pāsādika Sutta the threefold training is called brahmacariyā. DA.i.179; MA.i.275.'],

The cetiya was originally a shrine dedicated to some divinity (devatthāna) and built on a great rock, hence its name. Later, it was converted into a vihāra for the Buddha, being within easy reach of the town. Sakka built there a great hall (mandapa) for the Buddha (SNA. 583, 584).

He became drunk, and fastening his lute round his neck, he went with his wife down to the river. The water filled his lute and he began to sink. His wife thereupon let go of his hand and came out of the river. Seeing him about to drown, the wife begged of him one song wherewith to earn her living. He sang her a stanza to the effect that the water of the Ganges, which was the salvation of many, proved to be his bane.<br>This story was among those related by the Bodhisatta in the Padakusalamānava Jātaka (J.iii.507f).

'pātaligāma':['The capital of Magadha and situated near the modern Patna. The Buddha visited it shortly before his death. It was then a mere village and was known as Pātaligāma. At that timeAjātasattu’s ministers,Sunīdha and Vassakāra, were engaged in building fortifications there in order to repel the Vajjīs. The Buddha prophesied the future greatness of Pātaligāma, and also mentioned the danger of its destruction by fire, water, or internal discord. The gate by which the Buddha left the town was called Gotamadvāra, and the ferry at which he crossed the river, Gotamatittha (Vin.i.226 30; D.ii.86ff).<br>The date at which Pātaliputtta became the capital is uncertain.Hiouen Thsang seems to record (Beal: Records ii.85, n. 11) that it was Kālāsoka who moved the seat of government there. TheJains maintain that it wasUdāyi, son of Ajātasattu (Vin. Texts ii.102, n. 1). The latter tradition is probably correct as, according to the Anguttara Nikāya (iii.57) even Munda is mentioned as residing at Pātaliputta. It was, however, in the time of Asoka that the city enjoyed its greatest glory. In the ninth year of his reign Asoka’s income from the four gates of the city is said to have been four hundred thousand kahāpaṇas daily, with another one hundred thousand for his sabhā or Council (Sp.i.52).<br>The city was known to the Greeks as Pālibothra, and Megasthenes, who spent some time there, has left a vivid description of it (Buddhist India 262f). It continued to be the capital during the greater part of the Gupta dynasty, from the fourth to the sixth century A.C. Near Pātaliputta was theKukkutārāma, where monks (e.g. Ananda, Bhadda and Nārada) stayed when they came to Pātaliputta (M.i.349; A.v.341; A.iii.57; S.v.15f., 171f). At the suggestion of Udena Thera, the brahmin Ghotamukha built an assembly hall for the monks in the city (M.ii.163).<br>Pātaligāma was so called because on the day of its foundation several pātali shoots sprouted forth from the ground. The officers of Ajātasattu and of the Licchavi princes would come from time to time to Pātaligāma, drive the people from their houses, and occupy them themselves. A large hall was therefore built in the middle of the village, divided into various apartments for the housing of the officers and their retainers when necessary. The Buddha arrived in the village on the day of the completion of the building, and the villagers invited him to occupy it for a night, that it might be blessed by his presence. On the next day they entertained the Buddha and his monks to a meal (Ud.viii.6; UdA.407ff).<br>Pātaliputta was also called Pupphapura (Mhv.iv.31, etc.; Dpv.xi.28) and Kusamapura (Mbv.p.153).<br>The journey from Jambukola, in Ceylon, to Pātaliputta took fourteen days, seven of which were spent on the sea voyage to Tāmalitti (E.g., Mhv.xi.24). TheAsokārāma built by Asoka was near Pātaliputta (Mhv.xxix.36). The Buddha’s water pot and belt were deposited in Pātaliputta after his death (Bu.xxviii.9).<br>The Peta Vatthu Commentary (p.271) mentions that trade was carried on between Pātaliputta and Suvannabhūmi.'],

Pāthika dissuaded her from so doing; but one day, unbeknown to him, she sent her son to invite the Buddha. The boy called at Pāthika’s hermitage on the way, and the ascetic tried to dissuade him from going. Failing to do so, he told him not to tell the Buddha where to find the house, hoping that thus they would be able to eat themselves all the food prepared for the Buddha. The boy did as he was told, and the next day he and Pāthika hid in a room at the back of the house. The Buddha came, and, after the meal, thanked the woman.

Later, the Buddha visited the hermitage of Pātikaputta, with a large following, in order to refute his claims, but Pātikaputta avoided him and went to the Tindukhānuparibbājakārāma. A message was sent to him asking him to come as the Buddha was at his hermitage, but Pātikaputta was unable to arise from his seat.

'pātimokkha':['The name given to a set of two hundred and twenty seven rules to be observed by members of the Buddhist Order. The rules are not ethical but mainly economic, regulating the behaviour of the members of the Order towards one another in respect of clothes, dwellings, furniture, etc., held in common. In four cases out of the two hundred and twenty seven the punishment for infringement of a rule is exclusion from the Order; in all the remaining cases, it is merely suspension for a time.<br>The rules are arranged in seven sections<br>Pārajikā Dhammā Sanghādisesā-pātimokkha Aniyatā Nissaggiyāpācittiyā Pācittiyā-pātimokkha Patidesanīyā Sekkiyā pātimokkhacorresponding very roughly to the degree of weight attached to their observance.<br>The Pātimokkha is not included in the extant Buddhist Canon. The rules are included, in the Sutta Vibhaṅga (”sutta” here meaning ”rule”), which contains besides the rules themselves, an old Commentary explaining them and a new Commentary containing further supplementary information concerning them. The rules are divided into two parts: one for the monks (Bhikkhu Pātimokkha) and the other for the nuns (Bhikkhuknī Pātimokkha). It is a moot point whether the rules originally appeared with the explanatory notes (as in the Vibhaṅga), the Pātimokkha being subsequently extracted, or whether the Pātimokkha alone was the older portion, the additional matter of the Vibhaṅga being the work of a subsequent revision. For a discussion of this, see Vin.i. Introd.xvi; Law: Pāli. Lit. 2ff.; Hastings: Encyclopaedia under Pātimokkha.<br>It is sometimes suggested (Law: op. cit., p.2) that the original number of Pātimokkha rules numbered only about one hundred and fifty. A passage in the Anguttara Nikāya (i.231-232) is quoted in support of this suggestion (sādhikam diyaddhasikkhāpadasatam). According to this theory the seventy five Sekhiyā rules were added later. See Law: op. cit., 19f.; Law’s argument, however, that the Pātimokkha rules were among the texts not recited at the First Council, is due to a wrong understanding of the Sumaṅgala Vilāsinī passage (i.17).<br>The rules were recited at the gatherings of members of the Order (the Uposatha khandha of the Mahā Vagga (Vin.i.101 36) gives details of the procedure at these gatherings) in their respective districts on uposatha days (the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month). Each section of the rules is recited and, at the end of such recital, the reciter asks the members of the Order who are present if any one of them has infringed any of the rules. Silence implies absence of guilt. This practice of interrupting the recital seems to have been changed later (see Vin.ii.240 ff.) even though the old formula, asking the members to speak, continued as a part of the recital.<br>The word pātimokkha is variously explained, the oldest explanation being that the observance of the rules is the face (mukham), the chief (pamukham) of good qualities. The Sanskritised form of the word being prātimoksa, this led to a change in its significance, the completion of the recital being evidence that all those who have taken part are pure in respect of the specified offences - pātimokkha thus meaning acquittal, deliverance or discharge. But in most contexts the word simply means code - i.e., code of verses for the members of the Order.<br>For a detailed account of the Pātimokkha rules see Law: Pāli Literature, 49 ff.'],
'pātimokkha sutta':['A monk asks the Buddha for a brief teaching.

'pāvā':['A city of the Mallas which the Buddha visited during his last journey, going there from Bhogagāma and stopping at Cunda’s mango grove.<br>Cunda lived in Pāvā and invited the Buddha to a meal, which proved to be his last.

He was very greedy, and went about with a large bowl made of dried gourd, which he kept under his bed at night and which made a scraping sound when touched; but the Buddha refused to allow him a bag for it until it should be worn down by constant contact. Later he followed the Buddha’s advice, conquered his intemperance in diet, and became an arahant. He then announced before the Buddha his readiness to answer the questions of any doubting monks, thus uttering his ”lion’s roar.” The Buddha declared him chief of the ”lion roarers.” (A.i.23; AA.i.112f.; ThagA.i.245f.; UdA. 252; SA.iii.26). The Udāna (iv.6) contains the praise uttered by him of the Buddha, because of his perfected self mastery.<br>Pindoḷa was in the habit of taking his siesta in Udena’s park at Kosambī. (He had been king in a former birth and had spent many days in that park.) One day Udena’s women, who had come to the park with him, left him asleep and crowded round Pindoḷa to hear him preach. Udena, noticing their absence, went in search of them, and, in his anger, ordered a nest of red ants to be put on Pindoḷa’s body. But Pindoḷa vanished and returned to Sāvatthi, where the Buddha related the Mahānāga Jātaka* and also theGuhaṭṭhaka Sutta (SNA.ii.514f). Later, (S.iv.110f.; SA.iii.26) we find Udena consulting him at the same spot and following his advice regarding the control of the senses.<br>* J.iv.375 ff.; SA.iii.26 says that when the king went to fetch the red ants from an asoka tree, the ants fell on him and started to sting him. The women, under pretence of helping him, picked up the ants that fell from him and replaced them on his body, because they were angry at his rudeness to Pindoḷa.<br>In the Vinaya (Vin.ii.110f.; the story is given in greater detail at DhA.iii.201ff.; see also J.iv.263) we find the Buddha rebuking Pindoḷa for performing a cheap miracle. The setthi of Rājagaha had placed a sandal wood bowl on a high pole and challenged any holy person to bring it down. Pindoḷa heard of this and, at Moggallāna’s suggestion, rose in the air by magic power and brought it down. The Buddha blamed him for using his great gifts for an unworthy end. The bowl was given to the monks to be ground into sandal paste.<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Pindoḷa had been a lion in Himavā. The Buddha visited the lion in his cave, who waited on him for seven days, paying him great honour. Later, the lion died and was reborn in Hamsavatī, where he heard the Buddha preach and declare one of his disciples chief of the ”lion roarers.” Eight kappas ago he was a king named Paduma.

The life of a recluse is the meanest of callings to be called a ”scrap gatherer.” It is entered on by householders solely as a means of escaping from woe. The man who leaves the world and who yet does not fulfil the life of a recluse, is like a faggot from a funeral pyre, burnt at both ends and smeared with filth.

Thereupon he praised the Buddha and begged of him to go on. The Buddha preached to him further, and he became an anāgāmī, failing, however, to attain arahantship because his mind wandered to his maternal uncle, Bāvarī. His one thousand pupils, however, became arahants. Later, with the Buddha’s leave, he visited Bāvarī and told him the glad tidings, describing the Buddha’s glory (SN.vs.1131 45).

He asked their leader to help him, but he referred him to a junior monk, who, in his turn, referred him on, and so on, until at last he was forced to apply to the seven year old novice who sat doing needlework. With his pride humbled, Pothila asked him for advice. In order to test him, the novice asked him to jump into a pool with his robes on. This Pothila did, and the novice, satisfied as to his earnestness taught him how, in the case of an anthill with six holes into which a lizard entered, anyone, wishing to capture the lizard, would close up five of the holes. So with the six doors of the senses; close five doors, and concentrate on the door of the mind. At the end of the discourse, the Buddha appeared before Pothila in a ray of light and Pothila became an arahant (DhA.iii.417-21).<br>Two verses, addressed to him by Moggallāna, are given in the Theragāthā (Vs. 1174-5).'],

'puggalapaññatti':['The fourth (in the present order) of the seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. It is, however, generally considered to be the earliest of the Abhidhamma books. Its subject matter is the puggala (person). The author first gives a table of contents of the whole work, and then follows the method of the Anguttara Nikāya, grouping human types first under one term, then under two, and so on up to ten. Several of the sections are found, almost complete, in the corresponding sections of the Anguttara. Others are found in the Sangīti Sutta. For details see Morris’ edition in the P.T.S. series (Introd. x xi).'],
'pukkusa':['1. PukkusaA counsellor of Maddava, king of Benares. For details see the Dasannaka Jātaka. Pukkusa is identified with Sāriputta. J.iii.341.<br>2. PukkusaOne of the four ministers of Vedeha, king of Mithilā. He joined with his three companions in a conspiracy against Mahosadha, stealing a golden necklace from the king’s palace in order to try and implicate Mahosadha. The details are given in the Mahāummagga Jātaka (J.vi.330ff). On Pukkusa’s thigh was a leprous spot, which he hid from the king because the king loved to lay his head on Pukkusa’s lap. Only his younger brother knew of this secret; but it was discovered later by Mahosadha, and Pukkusa was sent to prison. Pukkusa is identified with Potthāpāda. Ibid., 478.<br>3. PukkusaA Mallarājaputta. He was a disciple of Alāra Kālama, and one day, while on his way from Kusinārā to Pāvā, he saw the Buddha seated under a tree by the roadside and stayed to talk to him. He mentioned that once five hundred carts had passed by where Ālāra sat, and yet so deep was he in meditation that he had failed to notice them. The Buddha told him how, when he himself was in Atumā in the Bhusāgāra, there was a great thunderstorm which killed two peasants and four oxen, but that he had heard and seen nothing, so deep was his concentration. Pukkusa was greatly impressed by this statement, and, having declared himself a follower of the Buddha, he gave to the Buddha two robes of cloth of gold, one of which, at the Buddha’s suggestion, he handed to Ananda. When Pukkusa had left, Ananda draped one robe over the Buddha, and was greatly astonished at its pale appearance in comparison with the deep gold of the Buddha’s body (D.ii.130ff).<br>Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.569) that Pukkusa was a merchant, and was the owner of the five hundred carts which had crossed the Kakkutthā shortly before the incident above mentioned.<br>4. PukkusaThe name of a caste, classified among the despised castes (E.g., A.ii.85; M.ii.152). The Commentary explains (E.g., AA.ii.523) them as ”those who sweep up flowers which are offered at shrines and are not removed by the devotees who have given them.” The word Pukkusa was evidently not despised as a personal name because, in the case of Pukkusa (3), for instance, the person bearing the name was a khattiya.'],
'pulacceri':['1. PulacceriA park laid out by Parakkamabāhu I. Cv.lxxix.11.<br>2. PulacceriA landing place in Ceylon where Māgha and Jayabāhu set up fortifications. Cv.lxxxiii.17.<br>Pulatthi nagara( pura). A capital of the Singhalese kings. It is first heard of in the reign of Aggabodhi III., who built in the town the Mahāpānadīpa vihāra (Cv.xliv.122). But it was probably an important centre even earlier, and Vijitapura, wrested from the Tamils by Dutthagāmaṇī, was probably near by (See Codrington, op. cit., 20). Sena I. first made Pulatthipura the capital (Cv.l.9, 46, 85), though even before his time it seems to have been used as a royal residence - e.g., by Aggabodhi IV. (Cv.xlvi.34), Aggabodhi VII. (Ibid.,xlviii.74), and Udaya I. (Ibid.,xlix.9, 18), who built a hospital there. Kassapa IV. is also mentioned as building a hospital against an epidemic (Cv.lii.25).<br>Mahinda II. built in the city the Dāmavihāra parivena and the Sannīratittha vihāra (Cv.xlviii.134). Sena I. reigned in Pulatthipura for twenty years and erected there several buildings, including the Senaggabodhi shrine near the Thusavāpī (Ibid.,l.73). The successors of Sena I. found in Pulatthipura a certain amount of protection from the inroads of the Colas and the Pāndiyans; but in the time of Sena V. the town fell into the hands of the Damilas, through the treachery of Sena’s mother and his commander in chief, Sena. But Sena V. recovered the city by making a treaty with his commander in chief (Ibid., liv.64, 68). About 1017 A.C. the Colas overran the country, captured Pulatthipura, and made the reigning king, Mahinda V., their prisoner. He died, after twelve years, as a prisoner in India (Ibid.,lv.22ff). During this period many of the Hindu shrines in the city were erected.<br>For many years the Colas held the sovereignty of the city, though the Singhalese made several vain attempts to drive them out. The Colas named the city Jananāthapura and put down all rebellion with a strong hand. Finally, a young prince named Kitti, born about 1039 A.C., assumed the title of Vijayabāhu and determined to rescue Pulatthipura. His first attempts failed, partly owing to rebellion among his own people; but finally, civil war broke out in the Cola country itself, and thus, about 1070, he captured Pulatthipura after a great deal of fierce fighting both on sea and land. But, owing to dissensions among his subjects, it was only several years later that he was able to hold his coronation (Cv.lvii.66; lviii.22 ff.; lix.6 ff). He renamed the city Vijayarājapura, and erected there many religious buildings, chief among which was the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Ibid.,lx.2ff). It was not, however, till the time of Parakkamabāhu I. that Palatthipura reached the pinnacle of its greatness. He enlarged it to the size of four gāvutas in length and seven in width and called it Parakkamapura. The city had three suburbs Rāvjavesībhujaṅga, Rājakulantaka and Vijita - and fourteen gates. Parakkama adorned it with various parks, chief of which were the Nandanavana and the Dīpuyyāna, and with ponds and numerous buildings, both secular and religious (for details see chiefly Cv.lxxiii.1ff.; lxxviii.44 ff). Kittinissaṅka added a stone temple for the Tooth Relic (Ibid., lxxx.19). In the reign of Līlavatī, Lokissara captured the city and ruled there for nine months. He was ousted by the general Parakkama, and later Parakkamapaṇḍu ruled as king, till he was deposed about 1215 A.C. by Māgha of the Kalinga race, who, coming with a large host of Keralas and Malabars, captured the city and mercilessly plundered its possessions (Ibid., lxxxiii.15 ff). From this spoliation the city never completely recovered, and it gradually lost its importance, though Parakkamabāhu II., Vijayabāhu IV. and Parakkamabāhu III. made attempts to restore it to its original splendour.

'pūrana kassapa':['One of the six well known teachers, contemporaneous with the Buddha.

Kassapa is a brahmin gotta. The SNA (372) calls him an ājīvaka) that Pūrana Kassapa came by his name from the fact that as a result of his birth the number of slaves in a certain household reached one hundred. Owing to this fact he was never found fault with, even when he failed to do his work satisfactorily. But, in spite of this, he was dissatisfied and fled from his masters. He then had his clothes stolen by thieves and went about naked. His gotta name was Kassapa. He had a following of five hundred, among whom was the deva putta Asama (S.i.65, see also Ajātasattu). He was consulted by the Licchavis Abhaya (S.v.126) and Mahāli (S.iii.68) and by the wanderer Vacchagotta (S.iv.398). He claimed to be omniscient. (A.iv.428; here we probably have a more correct explanation of his name, Pūrana - i.e., in his claim to have attained perfect wisdom, pūranañānna).<br>A story in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iii.208)* states that when the heretics were unable to prevent the Buddha from performing the Twin Miracle under the Gandamba, they fled discomfited. Pūrana Kassapa was among them, and in the course of his flight, he came across one of his followers, a farmer, who was on his way to see him, carrying a vessel of broth and a rope. Pūrana took the vessel and the rope, and going to the banks of the river near Sāvatthi, tied the vessel round his neck and threw himself into the stream. There was a circle of bubbles on the water and Pūrana was reborn in Avīci. The Milindapañha (p. 4 f) also mentions a Pūrana Kassapa, contemporary with Milinda. This perhaps refers to a teacher descended from the same school who is credited with the view that the earth rules or sustains the world. v.l.

Wishing to devour her as well, Pūtimamsa suggested to Venī that he should pretend to be dead and that Venī should then entice Melamātā into the cave by asking her to assist in the funeral rites. But the goat was wise and observant and discovered the ruse. Venī went to her later and saying that Pūtimamsa had recovered consciousness at the very sight of her, invited her to join them in a feast to celebrate his recovery. Melamātā, agreed, saying that she would bring with her a large escort of her friends, fierce dogs, including Maliya, Pingiya, Caturakkha and Jambuka, in order that the celebration might be a great one.

Immediately all the evil spirits fled from the city and the people recovered from their diseases. They then gathered at the Mote hall with various offerings and thither they conducted the Buddha. In the assembly were present not only all the inhabitants of Vesāli, but also the devas of two deva worlds, with Sakka at their head. The Buddha preached the Ratana Sutta to this great crowd. Another account, quoted by Buddhaghosa (DhA.iii.165), says that in the assembly the Buddha preached only the first five stanzas, the rest having been earlier recited by Ananda. Because this sutta was first preached to ward off the evil from Vesāli, it became the most famous of Buddhist Ward runes (Parittā)<br>The sutta consists of seventeen verses: the first two contain a request to the devas to receive the homage and offerings of men and protect them in their danger; then follow twelve verses, descriptive of the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. It ends with three verses purporting (DhA.iii.195) to have been spoken by Sakka on behalf of all the devas, expressing their adoration of the Buddha, his Dhamma and his Sangha.<br>It is also said (DhA.iii.196) that during this visit the Buddha stayed at Vesāli for two weeks, preaching the sutta on seven consecutive days; on each day eighty four thousand beings realized the Truth. The Sutta seems also to have been known as the Gangārohana Sutta (Cv.xxxvii.191).<br>When Ceylon was troubled by famine and plague in the reign of Upatissa II., the king had the sutta preached by monks while walking in the streets of the city. All troubles vanished, and he decreed that his successors should do likewise in times of need (Cv.xxxvii.195f). Sena II. had the whole sutta inscribed on a golden plate and held a great festival in its honour (Cv.li.79).<br>The sutta is given in the Mahāvastu (i.290ff), where it is described as Svastyanagāthā.<br>2.

To attain absolute Nibbāna, answers Punna, and, on being questioned further as to the nature of Nibbāna, he explains that Nibbāna is the goal and can only be attained by passing through various successive stages purity of life, purity of heart, purity of view, purity through dispelling doubts, purity through full insight into paths, right and wrong, into the path to be followed, and the purity which arises from insight. It may be compared to a journey of Pasenadi from Sāvatthi to Sāketa, by means of relays of seven carriages.<br>It is said in the introduction to the sutta that Sāriputta had been awaiting the opportunity of a discussion with Punna ever since he heard the monks at Veluvana in Rājagaha speak of him to the Buddha in terms of the highest praise.

See the Rādha Jātaka (2).<br>3. RādhaThe Bodhisatta born as a parrot. See the Kālabāhu Jātaka.<br>4. Rādha TheraHe was a brahmin of Rājagaha who, being neglected by his children in his old age, sought ordination. The monks refused his request on the ground of his age, so he sought the Buddha who, seeing his upanissaya, asked Sāriputta to admit him.* Soon after he won arahantship.<br>He stayed near the Buddha, and, by reason of his skill, the Buddha declared him foremost among those who could inspire speech in others (? patibhānakeyyānam) (A.i.25; ThagA.i.253f).<br>He thereby earned the name of Patibhāniya Thera (SA.ii.246).<br>The Theragāthā (vss.133 4) contains two verses spoken by him in praise of concentration of the mind.<br>The Rādha Samyutta (S.iii.188 201; see also Rādha Sutta) contains a large number of suttas preached by the Buddha in answer to Rādha’s questions on various topics.<br>It is said that when the Buddha saw Rādha he felt the inclination to talk on matters dealing with subtle topics, illustrating them with various similes. SA.ii.246; this was because of Radha’s wealth of views (ditthisamudācāra) and unwavering faith (okappaniya-saddhā); AA.i.179; also ThagA.i.254.<br>* It is probably this incident which is referred to at ThagA.ii.114, where Sāriputta is said to have ordained a poor brahmin named Rādha, but no mention is made of any order from the Buddha. If the reference is to this same thera, Rādha was, for some time, the attendant (pacchāsamana) of Sāriputta, and there is a verse in Thag. (993) spoken to him by Sāriputta, who was pleased with Rādha’s gentle manner. DhA.ii.104ff. gives more details of the ordination of Rādha. There we are told that he went to the monastery where he performed various duties. But the monks would not admit him into the Order, and, owing to his disappointment, he grew thin. One day the Buddha, seeing him with his divine eye, went to him, and hearing of his wish to join the Order, summoned the monks and asked if any of them remembered any favour done by Rādha. Sāriputta mentioned that he had once received a ladleful of Rādha’s own food while begging in Rājagaha. The Buddha then suggested that Sāriputta should listen to Rādha’s request for ordination. After ordination, Rādha grew weary of the food of the refectory, but Sāriputta constantly admonished him and found him most humble; later, he spoke highly of Rādha’s obedience, and the Buddha praised him. It was on Rādha’s account that the Alīnacitta Jātaka was preached. AA.i.179f. agrees, more or less, with the account given above; so does Ap.ii.485f.<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha, Rādha was a householder of Hamsavatī and held a great almsgiving in honour of the Buddha, wishing to gain pre eminence in the power of inspiring others to speak. He gave ripe mangoes to Vipassī Buddha (ThagA.i.253; AA.i.180; Ap.ii.484) and, as a result, was born in heaven.<br>Surādha Thera was his younger brother.

When the brahmin was away, his wife admitted men to the house and her husband set the birds to watch. Rādha wished to admonish her, but his brother said it was useless and they must await the brahmin’s return. Having told him what had happened, the two parrots flew away, saying they could not live there any longer.<br>Rādha is identified with Ananda (J.i.495f). The introductory story is identical with that of the Indriya Jātaka (No. 423).<br>2. Rādha Jātaka (No. 198)The Bodhisatta was once born as a parrot, brother to Potthapāda.

But Potthapāda, in spite of his brother’s warning, admonished the woman, who, in a rage, while pretending to fondle him, wrung his neck and threw him into the fire. When the brahmin returned, Rādha said he did not wish to share his brother’s fate, and flew away.<br>Potthapāda is identified with Ananda.

'rāhu':['An Asura chieftain (Asurinda) (cp. Mtu.iii.138, 254). The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.49f) says that on one occasion when he seized Candimā (Moon god), and on another Suriya (Sun god), both these invoked the aid of the Buddha. The Buddha then instructed Rāhu to let them free. Rāhu immediately let them go and ran to Vepacitti, ”trembling and with stiffened hair.” This incident evidently refers to the Indian myth of the eclipses, and the legend has been annexed by the Buddhists to illustrate the Buddha’s power and pity.<br>Elsewhere (A.ii.17) Rāhu is spoken of as the chief of those possessing personality (attabhāva). The Commentaries (E.g., AA.ii.474; DA.ii.487f.; MA.ii.790; SA.i.86, contains more details and differs slightly) explain that he is four thousand eight hundred leagues in height, and that the breadth of his chest is one thousand two hundred yojanas. His hands and feet are two hundred leagues long, each finger joint measuring fifty leagues, the space between the eyebrows also measuring fifty leagues. His forehead is fifty leagues broad, and his head nine hundred leagues in height. His face measures one hundred leagues, his nose three hundred, and the depth of his mouth one hundred. He is jealous of the gods of the Sun and the Moon, and stands in their paths with wide open mouth. When they fall into his mouth, the gods abandon their abodes and flee for their lives. Sometimes he caresses their abodes with his hand only, or with the lower part of his jaw, or with his tongue. Sometimes he takes them up and places them against his cheek; but he cannot stop the course of either the Sun or the Moon; if he attempts to do so, he will meet with disaster. So he journeys along with them.<br>The seizure of the Moon by Rāhu and the escape from him is often used as a simile (E.g., SN. vs. 465; J.i.183, 274; iii.364, 377; iv.330; v.453; DhA.iv.19, etc.). Rāhu is one of the four ”stains” (upakkilesā) of the Sun and the Moon, preventing them from shining in all their glory (A.ii.53; Vin.ii.295; cp. J.iii.365). He is further mentioned as one of the five causes of lack of rain (vassassa antarāya). When he gathers water into his hands and spills it into the ocean, there is no rain (A.iii.243). The idea seems to be that he gathers up the rain water which is in the sky in order to cool his body.<br>To bring Rāhu down from the sky is mentioned as one of the impossible tasks (J.iii.477).<br>It is said (DA.i.285; MA.ii.790f ) that for a long time Rāhu did not visit the Buddha, he thought that being so tall he would fail to see the Buddha. One day, however, he decided to go, and the Buddha, aware of his intention, lay on a bed when he arrived, and, by his iddhi power, contrived to make himself so tall that Rāhu had to crane his neck to see his face. Rāhu, thereupon, confessed his folly and accepted the Buddha as his teacher.<br>Rāhu is mentioned (D.ii.259) as being among the Asuras who were present at the Mahāsmaya and as blessing that assembly. In this context he is called Rāhubhadda. When Rāhu steps into the ocean, the water of the deepest part reaches only to his knees (DA.ii.488). Rāhu is also called Veroca, and Bāli’s hundred sons were called after him, he being their uncle (DA.ii.689). The name Rāhumukha is given to a form of torture (E.g., M.i.87; iii.164; Nid.154; Mil.197, 358), in which the victim’s mouth is forced open by a stake and fire or spikes are sent through the orifice of the ear into the mouth, which becomes filled with blood (AA.i.293).'],

This was probably the monastery built for nuns by Pasenadi, at the Buddha’s suggestion, after the assault on Uppalavannā in Andhavana, referred to in the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.52).<br>The Samyutta Commentary, however, gives a different account (SA.iii.218f.; the introductory story of the Bharu Jātaka; J.ii.170, gives the same account but omits the statement that the king built a vihāra). It states that the heretics, jealous of the Buddha and his popularity, desired to build a monastery for themselves in close proximity to Jetavana, and, in order that he might raise no objections, they presented Pasenadi with one hundred thousand.<br>When the Buddha discovered their intentions, owing to the great uproar they made while preparing the preliminaries of the building, he sent Ananda to the king, asking to have it stopped. But Pasenadi refused to see him or Sāriputta or Moggallāna. (It was as a punishment for this discourtesy that he lost the throne before his death.) Thereupon the Buddha went himself. Pasenadi received him and entertained him to a meal, at the end of which the Buddha preached to him the Bharu Jātaka on the evils of bribery and of creating an opportunity for virtuous people to quarrel among themselves. Pasenadi was filled with remorse; he had the heretics expelled, and, realizing that he had never built a monastery, proceeded to construct the Rājakārama.<br>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.360ff ) contains several sermons preached by the Buddha at the Rājakārāma.'],

Rājovāda Jātaka (No. 334)Once the king of Benares, wishing to discover if he ruled justly, traveled about in disguise, and, in the course of his wanderings, came to the Himālaya, where the Bodhisatta lived as an ascetic. The ascetic gave him ripe figs, and, when asked why they were so sweet, explained that the king of the country was evidently a just ruler. The king returned to his kingdom and ruled for a while unjustly; and returning again to the hermitage, he found that the figs had become bitter.<br>The story was related to Pasenadi, in order to show the importance of a king ruling wisely and justly.

He suffered from a virulent skin disease, and, leaving his kingdom to his eldest son, went into the forest, where he was cured by eating medicinal herbs. In the forest he met and married Piyā, the eldest daughter of Okkāka. She suffered from the same complaint, and was cured by him. They lived in the forest with their thirty two children. A forester recognized Rāma in the forest, and, on his return to the city, told the news to the king. The king went to the forest with his retinue and begged his father to return to the kingdom. He refused to do so, and, at his own suggestion, a city was built for him in the forest which was called Koliya or Vyagghapajja. Rāma thus became the ancestor of the Koliyans.<br>DA.i.260ff.; SNA.355f.; cf. Mtu.i.355, where he is called Kola.<br>3. Rāma. A brahmin, father of the Buddha’s teacher, Uddaka Rāmaputta.

Certain ruling princes of Ceylon claimed descent from Rāma - e.g., Jagatipāla (q.v.). Rāma’s fight with Rāvana and the incidents recounted in the Rāmāyana are mentioned only in the later Pāli Chronicles, such as the Cūlavamsa. Cv.lxiv.42; lxviii.20; lxxv.59; lxxxiii.46, 69, 88.<br>5.

He was an Inhabitant of Benares and greatly loved his parents. He once went on business to Kumbhavatī, in the country of Dandakī, and there, when the country was being destroyed owing to the wickedness of the king, Rāma thought of the goodness of his parents. The devas were moved by the power of this thought and conveyed him safely to his mother (J.v.29). He was one of the three survivors of the disaster which overtook Dandakī’s kingdom. MA.ii.602.<br>7. Rāma. One of the palaces of Kondañña Buddha in his last lay life. BuA.107; but see Bu.iii.26.<br>8. Rāma. One of the generals of Gajabāhu.

There the Nāgas, led by their king, Mahākāla, received it and took it to their abode in Mañjerika where a thūpa was built over them, with a temple attached, and great honour was paid to them.<br>When Dutthagāmāni built the Mahā Thūpa and asked for relics to be enshrined therein, Mahinda sent Sonuttara to the Nāga world to obtain these relics, the Buddha having ordained that they should ultimately be enshrined in the Mahā Thūpa. But Mahākāla was not willing to part with them, and Sonuttara had to use his iddhi power to obtain them. A few of the relics were later returned to the Nāgas for their worship.

'rāmaneyyaka thera':['Rāmaneyyaka TheraAn arahant. He belonged to a wealthy family of Sāvatthi, and left the world impressed by the presentation of Jetavana.

The verse he uttered on that occasion is included in the Theragāthā (Thag. vs. 49).<br>In the time of Sikhī Buddha, he had offered him flowers. Twenty nine kappas ago he was king under the name of Sumedhayasa (v.l. Sumeghaghana) (ThagA.i.120f). He is probably identical with Minelapupphiya of the Apadāna.

'rāmañña':['The Pāli name for Burma, referring particularly to the maritime provinces.<br>After the conversion of Rāmañña to Buddhism, there was a constant intercourse between that country and Ceylon (So says also Cv.lxxvi.10f). Vijayabāhu I. sent an embassy to Anuruddha, king of Rāmañña, and obtained from him learned and pious monks to re establish the Sangha in Ceylon (Cv.lxviii.8; lx.5ff.; but see Cv. Trs.i.n.4).<br>The kings of Rāmañña seem to have been in the habit of giving a special maintenance to Singhalese envoys sent to their country. The chief trade between the two countries was in elephants; the king of Rāmañña made a gift of an elephant to every vessel bringing gifts from foreign lands. In the time of Parakkamabāhu I., relations were strained between the two countries as a result of insults paid by the king of Rāmañña, and Parakkamabāhu sent a punitive expedition under the Damilādhikārin, ādicca. This expedition started from Pallavanka, and some of the forces landed at Kusumī in Rāmañña and the others at Papphālama. It is said that in a battle fought at Ukkama, the Singhalese forces killed the Rāmañña king. Thereafter, through the intervention of the monks, peace was restored between the two countries, and the Ramanas, as the people of Rāmañña were called, sent a yearly tribute to the king of Ceylon.

He went over to Ceylon and there founded a settlement which was named after him. Mhv.ix.10; Dpv.x.6.<br>4. Rohana. One of the three main provinces of early Ceylon comprising the south eastern part of the island, the Mahāvālukanadī forming its northern boundary. It was probably colonized by Rohana (3). The capital of the province was Mahāgāma. When the northern parts of the island were in the hands of foreigners or usurpers, the Singhalese court, its nobles and loyalists, often sought refuge in Rohana. It seems, for the most part, to have been very little controlled from the capital, and many rebellions against the ruler of the capital originated in Rohana. See Dutthagāmāni and Vijayabāhu; also, e.g., Mhv.xxiii.13; xxxiii.37; xxxv.27f., 67, 125; Cv.xxxviii.12, 39; xli.89ff.; xliv.54; xlviii.59, etc.<br>In times of persecution and scarcity the Buddhist monks found patronage and shelter among the inhabitants of Rohana (E.g., Mhv.xxxvii.6).

See Rohanta.<br>6. Rohana Thera. When Assagutta summoned the heads of the Order to a conference regarding the heresy of Milinda, Rohana was lost in meditation, and a messenger had to be sent to fetch him. As punishment for this, he was charged with the task of persuading Nāgasena to join the Order. To achieve this purpose, Rohana had to visit the house of Nāgasena’s father, Sonuttara, during seven years and ten months, without ever receiving even a kind word, till, at last, one day Sonuttara was pleased with his kindness and courtesy and gave him food daily at the house. When Nāgasena grew up and learnt the Vedas, Rohana engaged him in discussion, as a result of which Nāgasena joined the Order under Rohana, who, as his first preceptor, taught him the Abhidhamma. One day, Nāgasena thought lightly of his teacher, and Rohana, reading his thoughts, chided him. Nāgasena begged his forgiveness, but Rohana said he would forgive him only if he succeeded in refuting Milinda’s heretical views. Mil. 7ff.<br>7. Rohana. Headman of the village of Kitti and father of Theraputtābhaya. Rohana was a supporter of Mahāsumma Thera, and, having heard him preach at the Kotapabbata vihāra, he became a sotāpanna and joined the Order, later attaining arahantship. Mhv.xxiii.55ff.'],

One day Khemā, wife of the king of Benares, dreamed that a golden deer preached to her and begged the king to make the dream come true. The king offered great rewards, and a hunter, who was aware of Rohanta’s existence, undertook to bring him to the court. He set a trap in the ford where the deer drank and Rohanta was caught in it. When Rohanta gave the alarm, all the deer fled except Cittamiga and Sutanā. They told the hunter that they would die with their brother rather than leave him, and the hunter, touched by their devotion, set Rohanta free. When Rohanta discovered why he had been caught, he offered to go to Benares, but was dissuaded by the hunter owing to the risks he would run. Rohanta then taught the Law to the hunter and sent him back with a golden hair from his body. The hunter related the story to the king and queen and preached to them the Law. Then rejecting the rewards they offered him, he became an ascetic in the Himālaya.<br>The story was related in reference to Ananda’s attempt to throw himself before the elephant Dhanapāla, who was sent to kill the Buddha. Ananda is identified with Cittamiga, Channa with the hunter, Sāriputta with the king and Uppalavannā with Sutanā.

The Buddha agreed to do this, and by means of the power of his compassion, Roja was induced to visit him again. The Buddha preached to Roja, who asked, as a boon, that the monks should accept hospitality only from him. This request was refused by the Buddha, who said that Roja must take his turn with others in showing hospitality to him and his monks. Finding that he had long to wait for his turn, Roja made enquiries, and, discovering that the monks had no supply of green vegetables (dāka) or pastry (pittakhādaniya), he consulted Ananda, and, with the Buddha’s sanction, offered these things to the Buddha and his monks (Vin.i.247ff).<br>It is said (J.ii.231f) that Roja once invited Ananda to his house, and, after entertaining him lavishly, tried to induce him to leave the Order by offering him half his wealth.

This embittered her against the monks, and, though she gave them alms when they came to the house, she blamed them for having enticed her children away.<br>Once when Sāriputta visited her with five hundred monks, among whom was Rāhula, she invited them in and gave them food, but did not fail to abuse her son, calling him ”eater of leavings” (ucchitthakhādaka) (DhA.iv.164f). She outlived Sāriputta, who visited her just before his death, at Nālakagāma, in the house where he was born. There she provided lodging for him and his five hundred companions. Sāriputta fell ill of a violent attack of dysentery on the night of his arrival, and she saw various gods, including even Mahā Brahmā, come to wait on him.

When the Bodhisatta had finished his recital, the jackal appeared before him, and saying: ”Ho, brahmin, I have learnt your spell,” ran away. The Bodhisatta chased him, but in vain. As a result of learning the spell, the jackal subdued all the creatures of the forest and became their king, under the name of Sabbadātha. On the back of two elephants stood a lion and on the lion’s back sat Sabbadātha, with his consort.<br>Filled with pride, the jackal wished to capture Benares, and went with his army and besieged the city. The king was alarmed, but the Bodhisatta reassured him, and, having learnt from Sabbadātha that he proposed to capture the city by making the lions roar, gave orders to the inhabitants to stop their ears with flour. Then he mounted the watch tower and challenged Sabbadātha to carry out his threat. This Sabbadātha did, and even the lions on which he rode joined in the roar. The elephants were so terrified that, in their fright, they dropped Babbadātha, who was trampled to death. The carcases of the animals which died in the tumult covered twelve leagues.<br>The story was related in reference to Devadatta’s attempts to injure the Buddha, which only resulted in working harm upon himself.<br>The jackal is identified with Devadatta and the king with Ananda (J.ii.242 6).<br>The story is referred to in the Milinda-Pañha (Mil.

In the course of his studies, he returned to Vesāli with his teacher and visited his family. His former wife, afflicted, thin, in sad array and in tears, greeted him and stood by. Seeing her thus, he was overwhelmed with love and pity and felt carnal desire. When he realized this, he was filled with anguish and hurried to the charnel field, there to meditate on foulness. He developed insight and became an arahant.

The doe, though not in the net, remained near, out of love for her young, yet not daring to approach the snare. The Thera was much moved by the thought of all the suffering which was caused by love. Farther on he saw bandits wrapping in straw a man whom they had caught and were preparing to set on fire. The Thera was filled with anguish, and, developing insight, won arahantship.

Ud.vi.7, where the Buddha commends his proficiency in meditation). It is said that when he went begging for alms he would develop mettā-jhāna at each door, hence every gift made to him was of the highest merit. In the course of his travels he came to Rājagaha, and Bimbisāra promised to build him a dwelling-place. But the king forgot his promise, and Subhūti meditated in the open air.

He asked one of his monks, proficient in mettā and eminent in receiving gifts, to preach the anumodanā. At the end of the sermon all the other hermits became arahants, but Nanda’s attention was fixed on the majesty of the preaching monk, and he did not reach any attainment.

The Bodhisatta, who was an ascetic living on the bank of the river, rescued Duttha and his companions and looked after them. When they bade him farewell, the snake said that he had forty crores hidden in a certain spot, and the ascetic had only to ask for these and they were hits.

'saddhā tissa':['1. King of Ceylon (77 59 B.C.). He was the brother of Dutthagāmaṇī and was about a year younger. When he was ten, at the ceremony of initiation, he was forced to make a vow that he would never fight against his brother; but when his father, Kākavannatissa, died, he seized the throne in the absence of Dutthagāmaṇī. Up to that time he had been in charge of the Dīghavāpi district. Dutthagāmaṇī now made war upon him, but was defeated at Cūlaṅganiyapitthi. Later the tide turned, and Tissa had to flee to a monastery. Dutthagāmaṇī surrounded the monastery, but some young monks carried Tissa out on a bed, covered up like a dead body. Gāmanī discovered the ruse, but refrained from action. Through the intervention of Godhagatta Tissa Thera, the brothers were reconciled, and, thereafter, seem to have been devoted to one another.<br>After Gāmanī’s conquest of Anurādhapura, Tissa seems to have returned as governor of Dīghavāpi. When Gāmanī lay dying, Tissa was sent for to complete the work of the Mahā Thūpa, that the king might see it before his death. This he got done by means of temporary structures, cunningly devised. He was enjoined to retain unimpaired all the services on behalf of the religion inaugurated by his brother, and, when the latter died, he was succeeded by Tissa, who ruled for eighteen years. He rebuilt the Lohapāsāda after it was burnt down, and erected many vihāras - Dakkhināgiri, Kallakālena, Kalambaka, Pettaṅgavālika, Velaṅgavitthika, Dubbalavāpitissaka, Dūratissaka, Mātuvihāraka and Dīghavāpi. He built a vihāra to every yojana on the road from Anurādhapura to Dīghavāpi. He had two sons, Lañjatissa and Thūlathana.<br>Tissa was reborn after death in Tusita, and will be the second Chief Disciple of Metteyya Buddha. Mhv.xxii.73, 83; xxiv2ff.; xxxii.83; xxxiii.4 17; Dpv.xx 2, 4ff.<br>He was a very pious king, entirely devoted to the cause of religion. Various stories are mentioned about him in the Commentaries (See, e.g., Kālabuddharakkhita). He once walked five leagues to Maṅgana to pay his respects to Kujjatissa (q.v.) (AA.i.384f). On another occasion, he gave snipe to a novice from Kanthaka sālaparivena who would, however, accept only very little. Pleased with his moderation, the king paid him great honour (AA.i.264). He seems to have been specialty fond of the monks of Cetiyagiri (See VibhA.473). He was, apparently, also known as Dhammika Tissa. Dhammika Tissa once distributed one hundred cartloads of sugar (gula) among twelve thousand monks. A seven year old novice was sent by a monk who had just come to Cetiyagiri from Anurādhapura to fetch for him some sugar, about the size of a kapittha fruit. The attendant offered to give him a plateful, but the novice refused to take so much. The king heard the conversation, and, pleased with the novice, sent a further four hundred cartloads of sugar to be given to the Order (E.g., SA.iii.48). See also the story of Kukkutagiri.<br>2. Saddhātissa.-A minister. He once gave to Pindapatikatissa Thera of Sudassanapadhanasala a bowl of food which he had bought for 8 kahapanas. The monk became an arahant before eating it. The deity of the king’s parasol applauded and king Saddhātissa having sent for him gave him the district of Vaddhamanananagara. Later he shared with 30,000 monks water brought to him by the devas during a drought. The king hearing of this gave him Antaragaṅga. Sometime afterwards he became a sotāpanna, gladdened by the sight of 12,000 monks walking round Ambatthala cetiya clad in robes given by him. Ras.ii.9f.'],

'sahakapati':['See Sahampati.'],
'sahampati':['A Mahābrahmā.<br>When the Buddha was at the Ajapālanigrodha, hesitating as to whether or not he should preach the Dhamma, Sahampati appeared before him and begged of him to open to the world the doors of Immortality. The Buddha agreed to this urgent request (Vin.i.5f.;S.i.137f), and accepted from Sahampati the assurance that all the Buddhas of the past had also had no other teacher than the Dhamma discovered by them. S.i.139; see also S.v.167f.,185, 232, where he gives the same assurance to the Buddha regarding the four satipatthānas and the five indriyas; A.ii.10f.<br>Buddhaghosa (E.g., SA.i.155) explains that the Buddha was reluctant to preach, not on account of indolence, but because he wished Sahampati to make him this request. For, thought the Buddha, the world honours Brahmā greatly, and when people realized that Brahmā himself had begged of the Buddha to spread his teaching, they would pay more attention to it. Sahampati was, at this time, the most senior of the Brahmās (jettha-Mahābrahmā) (DA.ii.467).<br>Sahampati once saw that the brahminee, mother of Brahmadeva Thera, habitually made offerings to Brahmā. Out of compassion for her, Sahampati appeared before her and exhorted her to give her offerings to Brahmadeva instead (S.i.140f). On another occasion, when Kokāliya died and was born in Padumaniraya, Sahampati appeared before the Buddha and announced the fact to him (SN. p.125; cp. S.i.151; A.v.172).<br>The Samyutta (S.i.154f) contains a series of verses spoken by Sahampati atAndhakavinda, when the Buddha sat out in the open during the night and rain fell drop by drop. The verses are in praise of the life and practices of the monks and of the results thereof. Sahampati again visited the Buddha, simultaneously with Sakka, and as they stood leaning against a doorpost of the Buddha’s cell, Sakka uttered a verse in praise of the Buddha. Sahampati then added another verse, exhorting the Buddha to preach the Doctrine, as there were those who would understand (S.i.233). A verse spoken by him immediately after the Buddha’s death is included in the books (D.ii.157; S.i.158).<br>During the time of Kassapa Buddha, Sahampati was a monk, named Sahaka, who, having practised the five indriyas (saddhā, etc.), was reborn in the Brahma world. Thereafter he was called Sahampati (S.v.233). The Commentaries say (SNA.ii.476; SA.i.155) that he was an Anāgāmī Brahmā born in the Suddhāvāsā, there to pass a whole kappa, because he had developed the first Jhāna as a monk. The Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA.p.11; see also p.29) says that, strictly speaking, his name should be ”Sahakapati.” When the Buddha attained Enlightenment, Sahampati held over the Buddha’s head a white parasol three yojanas in diameter. BuA.239; this incident was sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.74); cp. J.iv.266.<br>Once he offered to the Buddha a chain of jewels (ratanadāma) as large as Sineru (KhA.171; Sp.i.115; Vsm.201). On the day that Alindakavāsi Mahāphussadeva attained arahantship, Sahampati came to wait upon him (VibhA.352).<br>It has been suggested (VT.i.86, n.1) that Brahmā Sahampati is very probably connected with Brahmi Svayambhū of brahmanical literature.'],

'sakka':['1. SakkaAlmost always spoken of as “devānam indo,” chief (or king) of the devas.<br>The Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.229; DhA.i.264) contains a list of his names:<br>he is called Maghavā, because as a human being, in a former birth, he was a brahmin named Magha. (But see Magha; cf. Sanskrit Maghavant as an epithet of Indra). As such he bestowed gifts from time to time, hence his name Purindada (Cf. Indra’s epithet Purandara, destroyer of cities) (generous giver in former births or giver in towns). Because he gives generously and thoroughly (sakkaccam) he is known as Sakka. Sakra occurs many times in the Vedas as an adjective, qualifying gods (chiefly Indra), and is explained as meaning “able, capable.” It is, however, not found as a name in pre Buddhist times. Because he gives away dwelling places (āvasatham) he is called Vāsava (But see Vāsava). Because in one moment he can think of one thousand matters, he is called Sahassakkha (also Sahassanetta). Because he married the Asura maiden Sujā, he is called Sujampati. For the romantic story of Sakka’s marriage, see Sujā. Thus Sujā’s father, Vepacitti, became Sakka’s father in law. Several quaint stories are related about father and son in law. The two sometimes quarrelled and at others lived together in peace (SA.i.265). Because he governs the devas of Tāvatimsa he is called Devānam Indo (See Inda). Elsewhere (E.g., D.ii.270; M.i.252) Sakka is addressed as Kosiya. He is also spoken of as Yakkha. M.i.252; cf. S.i.206 (Sakkanāmako Yakkho); at S.i.47 Māghadevaputta (Sakka) is called Vatrabhū, slayer of Vrtra (SA.i.83); Sakka is also, in the Jātakas, called Gandhabbarāja (J.vi.260) and Mahinda (J.v.397, 411). Sakka rules over Tāvatimsa devaloka, the lowest heaven but one of the lower plane. His palace isVejayanta and his chariot bears the same name. Though king of the Tāvatimsa devas, he is no absolute monarch. He is imagined rather in the likeness of a chieftain of a Kosala clan. The devas meet and deliberate in the Sudhammā sabhā and Sakka consults with them rather than issues them commands. On such occasions, the Four Regent Devas are present in the assembly with their followers of the Cātummahārājika world (See, e.g., D.ii.207f., 220f). Among the Tāvatimsa devas, Sakka is more or less primus inter pares, yet lie surpasses his companions in ten things: length of life, beauty, happiness, renown, power; and in the degree of his five sense experiences: sight, hearing, smelling, taste and touch. A.iv.242; these are also attributed to the rulers of the other deva worlds.<br>In the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.228, 229, 231; cf. Mil. 90; for details of these see Magha) the Buddha gives seven rules of conduct, which rules Sakka carried out as a human being, thus attaining to his celestial sovereignty. When the devas fight the Asuras they do so under the banner and orders of Sakka. For details of Sakka’s conquest of the Asuras see Asura. The Asuras called him Jara Sakka (J.i.202). Pajāpati, Vamna and Isāna are also mentioned as having been associated with him in supreme command (S.i.219).<br>In the Samyutta Nikāya a whole Samyutta - one of the shortest, consisting of twenty five short suttas - is devoted to Sakka.<br>In the first and second suttas Sakka praises energy (viriya); in the third he denounces timidity; in the fourth he shows forbearance to his enemy; (*16) in the fifth lie advocates the conquest of anger by kindness; in the sixth kindness to animals; in the seventh he denounces trickery, even towards enemies; and in the ninth he preaches courtesy and honour towards the wise. In the eleventh are described the seven life long habits which raised him to his present eminent position; twelve and thirteen repeat this and explain his titles. In the fourteenth Sakka explains how new gods, who outshine the old ones, do so because they have observed the Buddha’s teaching. In the fifteenth he describes as the most beautiful spot that where arahants dwell; in the sixteenth he praises gifts to the Order (*17); in the seventeenth he praises the Buddha, but is told by Sahampati that he has selected the wrong attributes for praise. In eighteen to twenty he says that whereas brahmins and nobles on earth and the gods of the Cātummahārājika world and of Tāvatimsa worship him, he himself worships good men and arahants. Numbers twenty one, twenty two, twenty four and twenty five are against anger, and twenty three is against deceit. *16 The enemy, in this case, is his father-in law, Vepacitta. Sakka had a reputation for great forbearance. In sutta 22 a Yakkha is said to have come and to have sat on his throne, to anger him. But Sakka showed him great honour and the Yakkha vanished. The Commentary adds (S.A.i.272) that it was no Yakkha, but a Rūpāvacara Brahmā, named Kodhabhakkha, who had come to test Sakka’s patience.<br>*17 The story connected with this sutta is that of Sakka, seeing the people of Anga and Magadha make preparations for a great sacrifice to Mahā Brahmā, feels pity for them and comes among them in the guise of Brahmā, advising them to take their offerings to the Buddha and seek his counsel (SA.i.270).<br>These and other passages show that Sakka was considered by the early Buddhists as a god of high character, kindly and just, but not perfect, and not very intelligent. His imperfections are numerous: in spite of his very great age, (*18) he is still subject to death and rebirth (A.i.144); as an example of this, it is mentioned that Sunetta had thirty five times been reborn as Sakka (A.iv.105), a statement confirmed by the Buddha (A.iv.89). Sakka is not free from the three deadly evils - lust, ill will, Stupidity (*22); nor is he free from anxiety. He is timid, given to panic, to fright, to running away. (*23)<br>*18 At J.ii.312, Sakka’s life is given as lasting thirty million and sixty times one hundred thousand years.<br>*22 A.i.144. The story of Rohini shows that Sakka was very susceptible to the charms of beauty. He evidently liked other people to enjoy life and sent a heavenly dancer to amuse Mahāpanāda when nobody on earth could accomplish that feat (SNA.ii.400). On another occasion, as Sakka was rejoicing in his triumph over the Asuras, he saw a crane on a hill top who wished to be able to eat fish without going down into the stream. Sakka immediately sent the stream in full flood, to the hill top (J.iii.252).<br>*23 He is mentioned in the Jātakas as frightened of ascetics who practised severe penances, lest they should unseat him from his throne, e.g., J.ii.394; also the stories of Visayha, Lomasakassapa, Kanha, Akitti, Mahā Kañcana and Isisinga.<br>In the Sakkapañha Sutta, Sakka is said to have visited the Buddha at Vediyagiri in Ambasandā and to have asked him a series of questions. He sends Pañcasikha with his vinā to play and sing to the Buddha and to obtain permission for him (Sakka) to visit him and question him. It was Sakka who had given the Beluvapaṇḍuvīnā to Pañcasikha (SNA.ii.394).<br>The Buddha says to himself that Sakka, for a long time past, has led a pure life, and gives him permission to question him on any subject. It is stated in the course of the sutta (D.ii.270) that it was not the first time that Sakka had approached the Buddha for the same purpose. He had gone to him at the Salaghara in Sāvatthi, but found him in meditation, with Bhuñjatī, wife of Vessavana, waiting on him. He therefore left with a request to Bhuñjatī to greet the Buddha in his name. He also declares (D.ii.286) that he has become a sotāpanna and has earned for himself the right to be reborn eventually in the Akanitthā world, whence he will pass entirely away.<br>The Commentary says that Sakka was constantly seeing the Buddha and was the most zealous of the devas in the discharge of his duties to the sāsana. DA.iii.697. In the sutta Sakka admits (D.ii.284) that he visited other brahmins and recluses as well. They were pleased to see him, and boasted that they had nothing to teach him; but he had to teach them what he knew. But this visit to the Buddha at Vediyagiri had a special object. Sakka saw sips that his life was drawing to an end and was frightened by this knowledge. He therefore went to the Buddha to seek his help. It adds (DA.iii.732; cp. DhA.iii.270) that, as Sakka sat listening to the Buddha, he died in his old life and was reborn a new and young Sakka; only Sakka himself and the Buddha was aware of what had happened. The Commentary continues (DA.iii.740) that Sakka became an ”uddham sota,” treading the path of Anāgāmīs. As such he will live in Avihā for one thousand kappas, in Atappa for two thousand, in Sudassanā for four thousand, and will end in the Akaniṭṭha world, after having enjoyed life in the Brahmaworlds for thirty one thousand kappas.<br>An account of another interview which Sakka had with the Buddha is given in the Cūlataṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta (q.v.). There the question arises regarding the extirpation of cravings. Sakka accepts the Buddha’s answer and leaves him. Anxious to discover whether Sakka has understood the Buddha’s teaching, Moggallāna visits Sakka and questions him. Sakka evades the questions and shows Moggallāna the glories of his Vejayanta palace. Moggallāna then frightens him by a display of iddhi-power, and Sakka repeats to him, word for word, the Buddha’s answer. Moggallāna departs satisfied, and Sakka tells his handmaidens that Moggallāna is a ”fellow of his” in the higher life, meaning, probably, that he himself is a sotāpanna and therefore a kinsman of the arahant.<br>In a passage in the Samyutta (S.i.201) Sakka is represented as descending from heaven to make an enquiry about Nibbāna, and in another (S.iv.269f.), as listening, in heaven, to Moggallāna’s exposition of the simplest duties of a good layman. On another occasion, at Vessavana’s suggestion, Sakka visited Uttara Thera on the Sankheyyaka Mountain and listened to a sermon by him (A.iv.163f.). See also Sakka Sutta (2) and (3).<br>The later books contain a good deal of additional information regarding Sakka. His city extends for one thousand leagues, and its golden streets are sixty leagues long; his palace Vejayanta is one thousand leagues high; the Sudhammā hall covers five hundred leagues, his throne of yellow marble (Pandukambalasilāsana) is sixty leagues in extent, his white umbrella with its golden wreath is five leagues in circumference, and he himself is accompanied by a glorious array of twenty five million nymphs (J.v.386). Other features of his heaven are the Pāricchattaka tree, the Nandā pokkharanī and the Cittalatāvana (DA.iii.716; See also Tāvatimsa). His body is three gavutas in height (DhA.iii.269); his chief conveyance is the marvellous elephant Erāvana (q.v.), but he goes to war in the Velayanta ratha (q.v.). Reference is often made to his throne, the Pandukambalasilāsana (q.v.), composed of yellow stone. It grows hot when Sakka’s life draws towards its end; or his merit is exhausted; or when some mighty being prays; or, again, through the efficacy of virtue in recluses or brahmins or other beings, full of potency. J.iv.8; when the Buddha, however, sat on it, he was able to conceal it in his robe (DhA.iii.218).<br>Sakka’s devotion to the Buddha and his religion is proverbial. When the Bodhisatta cut off his hair and threw it into the sky, Sakka took it and deposited it in the Cūlāmani cetiya (J.i.65). He was present near the Bodhi tree, blowing his Vijayuttara saṅkha (q.v.), when Māra arrived to prevent the Buddha from reaching Enlightenment (J.i.72). When the Buddha accepted Bimbisāra’s invitation to dine in his palace, Sakka, in the guise of a young man, preceded the Buddha and his monks along the street to the palace, singing the Buddha’s praises (Vin.i.38). When the Buddha performed his Yamaka pātihārīya at the foot of the Gandamba, it was Sakka who built for him a pavilion, and gave orders to the gods of the Wind and the Sun to uproot the pavilions of the heretics and cause them great discomfort (DhA.iii.206, 208). When the Buddha returned to Sankassa from Tāvatimsa, whither he went after performing the Twin Miracle, Sakka created three ladders - of gold, of silver, and of jewels respectively - for the Buddha and his retinue (DhA.iii.225).<br>Sakka was present at Vesāli when the Buddha visited that city in order to rid it of its plagues. His presence drove away the evil spirits, and the Buddha’s task was thus made easier (DhA.iii.441). When the Buddha and his monks wished to journey one hundred leagues, to visit Culla Subhaddā at Uggapura, Sakka, with the aid of Vissakamma, provided them with pavilions (kūtāgāra) in which they might travel by air (DhA.iii.470). Once, when the ponds in Jetavana were quite dry, the Buddha wished to bathe and Sakka immediately caused rain to fall and the ponds were filled (J.i.330). In Sakka’s aspect as Vajirapāni (q.v.) he protected the Buddha from the insults of those who came to question him. See also the story of Ciñcā mānavikā, when Sakka protected the Buddha from her charges. Sakka also regarded it as his business to protect the Buddha’s followers, as is shown by the manner in which he came to the rescue of the four seven year old novices - Sankicca, Pandita, Sopāka and Revata - when they were made to go hungry by a brahmin and his wife (DhA.iv.176f.).<br>During the Buddha’s last illness, Sakka ministered to him, performing the most menial tasks, such as carrying the vessel of excrement. DhA.iv.269f. He did the same for other holy men - e.g., Sāriputta. Sakka also waited on the Buddha when he was in Gayāsīsa for the conversion of the Tebhātikajaṭilas (Vin.i.28f.); see also the story of Jambuka (DhA.ii.59). The Udāna (iii.7) contains a story of Sakka assuming the guise of a poor weaver and Sujā that of his wife, in order to give alms to Mahā Kassapa who had just risen from a trance. They succeeded in their ruse, to the great joy of Sakka (cp. DhA.i.424f). On other occasions - e.g., in the case of Mahāduggata Sakka helped poor men to gain merit by providing them with the means for giving alms to the Buddha (DhA.ii.135ff.).<br>He was present at the Buddha’s death, and uttered, in verse, a simple lament, very different from the studied verses ascribed to Brahmā. (D.ii.157; on the importance of this verse, however, see Dial.ii.176, n.1). At the distribution, by Dona, of the Buddha’s relics, Sakka saw Dona hide the Buddha’s right tooth in his turban. Realizing that Dona was incapable of rendering adequate honour to the relic, Sakka took the relic and deposited it in the Cūlāmanicetiya (DA.ii.609). And when Ajātasattu was making arrangements to deposit his share of the relics, Sakka gave orders to Vissakamma to set up a vālasaṅghātayanta for their protection (DA.ii.613).<br>Sakka did all in his power to help followers of the Buddha in their strivings for the attainment of the goal, as in the case of Panditasāmanera, when he sent the Four Regent Gods to drive away the birds, made the Moon deity shroud the moon, and himself stood guard at the door of Pandita’s cell, lest he should be disturbed. (DhA.ii.143; cf. the story of Sukha DhA.iii.96f.). Often, when a monk achieved his ambition, Sakka was there to express his joy and do him honour. See, e.g., the story of Mahāphussa (SNA.i.55f.).<br>He was ready to help, not only monks and nuns, but also eminent laymen, such as Jotika for whom he built a palace of wondrous splendour, and provided it with every luxury (DhA.iv. 207f). Sakka was always ready to come to the rescue of the good when in distress - e.g., in the case of Cakkhupāla when he became blind; Sakka led him by the hand and took him to Sāvatthi. DhA.i.14f. Many instances are found in the Jātaka where Sakka rescued the good in distress - e.g., Dhammaddhaja, Guttila, Kaccāni, the Kinnarī Candā, Sambulā, Kusa, Mahājanaka’s mother, Candakumāra’s mother, Candā, and Mahosadha.<br>He loved to test the goodness of men, as in the case of the leper Suppabuddha, to see if their faith was genuine. DhA.ii.34f.; see also the story of the courtesan in the Kurudhamma Jātaka (J.ii.380).<br>The Jātaka contains several stories of his helping holy men by providing them with hermitages, etc. - e.g., Kuddāla paṇḍita, Hatthipāla, Ayoghara, Jotipāla (Sarabhaṅga), Sutasoma, Dukūlaka, Pārikā and Vessantara. Sometimes, when he found that ascetics were not diligently practising their duties, he would frighten them - e.g., in the Vighāsa and Somadatta Jātakas. The Anguttara Nikāya (iii.370f ) contains a story of Sakka punishing a deva called Supatittha, who lived in a banyan tree, because he failed to keep the rukkhadhamma.<br>Sakka appears as the guardian of moral law in the world. When wickedness is rampant among men, or kings become unrighteous, he appears among them to frighten them so that they may do good instead evil. He is on the side of the good against the wicked, and often helps them to realize their goal. Instances of this are seen in the Ambacora, Ayakūta, Udaya, Kaccāni, Kāma, Kāmanīta, Kumbha, Kelisīla, Kharaputta, Culladhanuggaha, Dhajavihetha, Bilārikosiya, Manīcora, Mahākaṇha, Vaka, Sarabhaṅga, Sarabhamiga and Sudhābhojana Jātakas. Sakka patronised good men; some of the more eminent he invited to his heaven, sending his charioteer Matali to fetch them, and he showed them all honour - e.g., Guttila, Mandhātā, Sādhina, and Nimi; others he rewarded suitably - see, e.g., the Uraga Jātaka.<br>The lesser gods consulted Sakka in their difficulties and problems e.g., in the case of the deity of Anāthapindika’s fourth gateway, who incurred the displeasure of Anāthapindika by advising him to refrain from too much generosity towards the Buddha and his monks (J.i.229). Sakka has also to deal with disputes arising among the devas themselves (DA.iii.705). On several occasions Sakka helped the Bodhisatta in the practice of his Perfections e.g., as King Sivi, Temiya, Nimi and Vessantara, also in his birth as a hare; in this last story, the Sasa Jātaka (q.v.), Sakka paints the picture of a hare in the moon to commemorate the Bodhisatta’s sacrifice.<br>Sakka sometimes answers the prayers of good and barren women and gives them sons - e.g., Sumedhā, Sīlavatī, Candādevī. Mention is also made of other boons granted by Sakka to various persons. Thus in the Mahāsuka Jātaka he visited the parrot who clung to the dead stump of a tree through gratitude, and granted him the boon that the tree should once more become fruitful (J.iii.493). He granted four boons to Kanha, that he might be calm, bear no malice or hatred against his neighbour, feel no greed for others’ glory, and no lust towards his neighbour (J.iv.10). To Akitti he granted several boons, the last of which was that he should have no more visits from Sakka! (J.iv.240f). When Sivi became blind, Sakka gave him two eyes; these were not natural eyes, but the eyes of Truth, Absolute and Perfect (saccapāramitā cakkhunī). Sakka confesses that he has not the power of restoring sight; it was the virtue of Sivi himself which had that power (J.iv.410f). When Sīlavatī wished for a boon, Sakka, took her to heaven, where he kept her for seven days; then he granted that she should have two sons, one wise and ugly and the other a fool and handsome. He also presented her with a piece of kusa grass, a heavenly robe, a piece of sandalwood, the flower of the Pāricchattaka tree and a Kokanda lute. All this passed into the possession of Kusa, and, later, Sakka gave him the Verocana jewel (J.v.280f., 310). He gave Phusatī, mother of Vessantara, ten boons (J.vi.481f) and to Vessantara himself he gave eight (J.vi.572).<br>In the Sarabhaṅga Jātaka (J.v.392) mention is made of four daughters of Sakka - āsā, Saddhā, Hirī and Sirī. His wife, Sujā, accompanied him everywhere on his travels (E.g., J.iii.491), even into the world of men, because that was the boon she had asked for on her marriage to him (DhA.i.279). Vessavana was Sakka’s special friend (MA.i.476f), and when one Vessavana died, it was Sakka’s duty to appoint a successor (J.i.328). Matāli (q.v.) is Sakka’s charioteer and constant companion. Vissakamma (q.v.) is his ”handy man.” Sakka has twenty five million handmaids and five hundred dove-footed nymphs (kakutapādiniyo), famed for their beauty. It was the sight of these which tempted the Buddha’s step brother, Nanda, to give up thoughts of Janapadakalyāṇī Nandā (J.ii.93). Sakka’s special weapon is the Vajirāvudha and his special drum the āḷambara (q.v.).<br>His voice is sweet, like the tintinnabulation of golden bells (SA.i.273).<br>It is Sakka’s special duty to protect the religion of the Buddha in Ceylon. As the Buddha lay dying, he enjoined on Sakka the task of looking after Vijaya and his successors. This duty Sakka, in turn, entrusted to the god Uppalavanna (Mhv.vii.1ff). Sakka informed Mahinda of the right moment for his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xiii.15). When Devānampiyatissa wished for relics to place in the Thūpārāma Thūpa, Sumana sāmanera visited Sakka and obtained from him the right collar bone of the Buddha, which Sakka had placed in the Culāmani cetiya (Mhv.xvii.9ff). Again, when Dutthagāmaṇī was in need of building materials for the Mahā Thūpa, it was Sakka who supplied them (Mhv.xxviii.6ff). On the occasion of the enshrining of the relics in the Mahā Thūpa, Sakka gave orders to Vissakamma to decorate the whole of Ceylon. He also provided the throne and casket of gold for the relics brought from the Nāgā world by Sonuttara and was himself present at the festival, blowing his conch shell. (Mhv.xxxi.34, 75, 78)<br>Other Cakkavālas have also their Sakka (aññehi Cakkavālehi Sakkā āgacchanti; J.i.203.), and in one place (J.i.204) mention is made of many thousands of Sakkas.<br>It is evident from the foregoing account that, as Rhys Davids suggests (Dial.ii.297f), Sakka and Indra are independent conceptions. None of the personal characteristics of Sakka resemble those of Indra. Some epithets are identical but are evidently borrowed, though they are differently explained. The conception of the popular god which appealed to a more barbarous age and to the clans fighting their way into a new country, seems to have been softened and refined in order to meet the ideals of a more cultured and peaceful civilization. The old name no longer fitted the new god, and, as time went on, Sakka came to be regarded as an entirely separate god.<br>2. Sakka. A Yakkha. See Sakka Sutta (1).<br>3. Sakka. Another form of Sākya.

The Buddha relates to him the visit of the Devas and tells him that a large number of them can stand in a space not greater than the point of a gimlet, and that, too, without crowding each other. This is because they have trained themselves to be tranquil in the senses and in the mind. Such tranquillity leads to tranquillity also of body, speech, and thought.

'samantakūṭa':['A mountain peak in Ceylon. It was the residence of the Deva Mahāsumana (Mhv.i.33) and when the Buddha visited the Island for the third time, he left on the mountain the mark of his footprint (Mhv.i.77; cf. Nammadā, and Saccabaddha). Owing to this, the mountain became a sacred place of pilgrimage. In later times many kings of Ceylon paid the shrine great honour. Vijayabāhu I. gifted the village of Gilīmalaya for the feeding of pilgrims, and set up rest-houses for them on the different routes, for the maintenance of which he provided. (Cv.ix.64f)<br>Kittinissaṅka made a special pilgrimage to Sumanakūta and mentioned it in his inscriptions (Cv.lxxx.24; Cv.Trs.ii.128, n.4). Parakkamabāhu II. did likewise, and also gave ten gāvutas of rich land for the shrine on the top of the peak (Cv.lxxxv.118). He further gave orders to his pious minister, Devappatirāja, to make the roads leading to the mountain easy of access. The minister repaired the roads, and built bridges at Bodhitala over the Khajjotanadī, at Ullapanaggāma, and at Ambaggāma. He constructed rest houses at suitable spots, and placed stepping stones on the way to the summit. Then the king himself visited the peak and held a great festival there lasting for three days (Cv.lxxxvi.9, 18 ff). Vijayabāhu IV., too, made a pilgrimage to the sacred mountain (Cv.lxxxviii.48).<br>King Vīravikkama also went there and lit a lamp, fifteen cubits in girth and five cubits high (Cv.xcii.17). Rājasūha I., in his desire to take revenge on the Buddhist monks, handed the shrine over to Hindu priests (Cv.xciii.12), but Vimaladhammasūriya II. restored to it all honours and held a great festival, lasting for seven days, at the peak (Cv.xcvii.16f). His son, Narindasīha, made two pilgrimages there (Cv.xcvii.31), while Vijayarājasīha had a feast of lamps celebrated there (Cv.xcviii.84). Kittisirirājasīha had a mandapa built round the footprint surmounted by a parasol, and assigned the revenues from the village of Kuttāpiti to the monks who looked after the shrine (Cv.c.221).<br>The districts round Samantakūta were, in early times, the habitation of the Pulindas. It was believed (Mhv.vii.67) that, when Vijaya forsook Kuvenī, her children fled thither and that their descendants were the Pulindas. In later times, too, mention is made (E.g., Cv.lxi.70) of the fact that the people dwelling in the neighbourhood of Samantakūtta refused to pay taxes to the king. From very early times the mountain was the dwelling of numerous monks. Thus, in the time of Dutthagāmaṇī, there were nine hundred monks there, under Malayamahādeva Thera (Mhv.xxxii.49). The Damila Dīghajantu offered a red robe to the ākāsacetiya in Samantagiri vihāra, and, as a result, won heaven, because he remembered the gift at the moment of his death (AA.i.376; MA.ii.955).

Elsewhere (S.i.239), however, it is said that once Sakka asked Vepacitti to teach him Sambara’s magic art (Sambarimāyā). Vepacitti consulted the Asuras and then warned Sakka against learning it because, through his art, Sambara had fallen into purgatory, where he had been suffering for a century. Buddhaghosa, in this context (SA.i.272), calls Sambara an Asurinda, a juggler (māyāvī) who, having practised his māyā, has roasted for the past century in purgatory.<br>Mrs. Rhys Davis (KS.i.306 n) thinks there was a rank of Sambara resembling that of Sakka, and that each succeeding Sambara learnt the magic art.

At once the king sends him with an escort and a present and a tablet of gold on which the answer may be written. Sucīrata visits other sages on the way, and finally Vidhura, who had been his school mate. When the question is asked, Vidhura refers it to his son Bhadrakāra, who, however, is busy with an intrigue with a woman and cannot give attention to the matter. He sends Sucīrata to his younger brother, Sañjaya, but he, too, is occupied, and sends him on to his brother Sambhava (the Bodhisatta), a boy of seven. Sucīrata finds him playing in the street, but when he is asked the question, he answers it with all the fluent mastery of a Buddha. All Benares, including the king, hears the answer and stays to listen. Sambhava is paid great honour and receives many presents.

When the Thera had finished his meditations, the Yakkhas gave him Vessavana’s message offering him protection. But he refused their protection saying that the mindfulness taught by the Buddha was sufficient guard.

Together they went to Sabbakāmī, and Sambhūta questioned him regarding the ”Ten Points.”<br>Sambhūta was one of the monks appointed to the committee to discuss the points raised, and when they were declared heretical, he joined in the holding of the Second Council.

Sotthisena gave himself up to pleasure and neglected Sambulā. The ascetic, returning, found her thin and miserable and, learning the reason, admonished Sotthisena.<br>The story was related in reference to Mallikā’s great devotion to her husband.

Once, while he was at the Tapodārāma musing on his good fortune as a monk, Māra tried to terrify him. Samiddhi told the Buddha of this, but the Buddha asked him to stay on where he was. He obeyed, and soon afterwards won arahantship. He then declared his aññā in a verse (Thag.vs.46), and Māra retired discomfited.

In another birth he saw a Pacceka Buddha and insulted him, calling him a ”leprous starveling” and spitting in his presence. For this he suffered long in hell, and was reborn on earth in the time of Kassapa Buddha. He became a Paribbājaka, and, losing his temper with a follower of the Buddha, cursed him ”May you become a leper.” He also soiled the bath powders placed by people at bathing places; hence his affliction in the present age (ThagA.i.175 f).<br>He is evidently identical with Jātipūjaka of the Apadāna.

The latter 5 are called ’higher fetters’ (uddhambhāgiya-saṃyojana),as they tie to the higher worlds, i.e. the fine-material and immaterial world (A.IX.67-68; A.X.13; D.33, etc.).<br>He who is free from 1-3 is a Sotāpanna, or Stream-winner, i.e. one who has entered the stream to Nibbāna, as it were.

He who is fully freed from 1-5 is an Anāgāmī, or ’Non-returner’ (to the sensuous world).

The Nikāya has been translated into Burmese. Bode, op. cit., 92.'],
'sanankumāra':['A Mahā Brahmā. In the Nikāyas (D.i.121; M.i.358; S.i.153; A.v.327) he is mentioned as the author of a famous verse, there quoted:<br>Khattiyo settho jane tasmim ye gottapatisārino Vijjācaranasampanno so settho devamānuse.In one place (S.ii.284) the verse is attributed to the Buddha, thus endowing it with the authoritativeness of a pronouncement by the Buddha himself. Sanankumāra is represented as a very devout follower of the Buddha.<br>In a sutta of the Samyutta (S.i.153), he is spoken of as visiting the Buddha on the banks of the Sappinī, and it was during this visit that the above verse was spoken. Sanankumāra was present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta (D.ii.261).<br>In the Janavasabha Sutta, Janavasabha describes to the Buddha an occasion on which Sanankumāra attended an assembly of the Devas, presided over by Sakka and the Four Regent Gods. There was suddenly a vast radiance, and the devas knew of the approach of Sanankumāra. As the usual appearance of the Brahmā is not sufficiently materialized for him to be perceived by the Devas of Tāvatimsa, he is forced to appear as a relatively gross personality which he specially creates. As he arrives, the Devas sit in their places with clasped hands waiting for him to choose his seat. Then Sanankumāra takes on the form of Pañcasikha (because all devas like Pañcasikha, says the Commentary, DA.ii.640) and sits, above the assembly, cross legged, in the air. So seated, he expresses his satisfaction that Sakka and all the Tāvatimsa Devas should honour and follow the Buddha. His voice has all the eight characteristics of a Brahmā’s voice. (These are given at D.ii.211). He then proceeds to create thirty three shaper, of himself, each sitting on the divan of a Tāvatimsa Deva, and addresses the Devas, speaking of the advantages of taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. Each deva fancies that only the shape sitting on his own divan has spoken and that the others are silent. Then Sanankumāra goes to the end of the Hall, and, seated on Sakka’s throne, addresses the whole assembly on the four ways of iddhi; on the three avenues leading to Bliss, as manifested by the Buddha; on the four satipatthānas, and the seven samādhiparikkhārā. He declares that more than twenty four lakhs of Magadha disciples, having followed the teachings of the Buddha, have been born in the deva worlds. When Sanankumāra has finished his address, Vessavana wonders if there have been Buddhas in the past and will be in the future. The Brahmā reads his thoughts and says there certainly were and will be.<br>Sanankumāra means ”ever young.” Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.584; cf. SA.i.171) that, in his former birth, he practised jhānas while yet a boy with his hair tied in five knots (pañcacūlakakumārakāle), and was reborn in the Brahma world with the thāna intact. He liked the guise of youth and continued in the same, hence the name. Rhys Davids (Dial.ii.292, n.3; cf.i.121, n.1) sees in the legend of Sanankumāra the Indian counterpart of the European legend of Galahad. The oldest mention of it is in the Chāndogya Upanisad (Chap. VII), where the ideal, yet saintly knight, teaches a typical brahmin the highest truths. In the Mahābhārata (iii.185, Bombay Edition) he expresses a sentiment very similar to that expressed in the stanza quoted above. In mediaeval literature he is said to have been one of five or seven mind born sons of Brahma who remained pure and innocent. A later and debased Jaina version of the legend tells in detail of the love adventures and wives of this knight, with a few words at the end on his conversion to the saintly life. See J.R.A.S.1894, p. 344; 1897, p.585 f; Revue de, Histoire des Religions, vol.xxxi.pp.29ff.<br>Sanankumāra Sutta.

On these heresies cf. Sāleyyaka Sutta. The reference is evidently to the teachings of Purāna Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla and others.<br>Ananda then proceeds to explain the four comfortless vocations:<br>the teacher who claims to be all knowing and all seeing; the teacher whose doctrine is traditional and scriptural; the rationalist of pure reason and criticism teaching a doctrine of his own reasoning; and, lastly, the teacher who is stupid and deficient.

When Dhānañjānī told Sangārava that he was there, Sangārava visited him and questioned him on his views on brahmins. The Buddha said he had great regard for brahmins who had here and now won the goal, having discovered unaided a doctrine before unknown. He himself was one of these. He then proceeds to describe how he came to leave the household life and how, in due course, he won Enlightenment.<br>Sangārava asks further whether there are any gods. The Buddha answers that of that there is no doubt; the whole world is in agreement on that point. Sangārava is pleased and accepts the Buddha as his teacher (M.ii.209ff).<br>Buddhaghosa says (MA.ii.808) that Sangārava was the youngest of the Bhāradvājas, brothers of Dhānañjānī’s husband.<br>The Samyutta (S.i.182f) mentions a Sangārava who is perhaps distinct from the above. He lived in Sāvatthi and was a ”bath ritualist,” believing in purification by water, bathing morning and evening. The Buddha, at Ananda’s request, visited his house and preached to him the Doctrine, after which he became the Buddha’s follower.<br>The Commentary (SA.i.207) explains that Ananda and Sangārava had, as laymen, been friends, and Ananda was anxious to prevent ”this wretch (varāko) who, for all our friendship has contracted wrong views, from becoming a hell filler; moreover he has a circle of friends, and hundreds may follow if he is converted.”<br>Another Samyutta passage (S.v.121f.; see Sangārava Sutta, 3) contains a sutta in which the brahmin Sangārava visits the Buddha and asks him why he can remember certain mantras with great case and others not at all. It may be this same brahmin who is mentioned several times also in the Anguttara. A.i.168 f; iii.230f.; v. 232, 252. For details see Sangārava Sutta (4-7).<br>The Commentary states (AA.i.396) that he was an overseer in charge of the repair of the dilapidated buildings in Rājagaha (Rājagahanagare jinnapatisaṅkhara nakārako āyuttakabrāhmano).'],
'sangārava sutta':['1. Sangārava Sutta. The 100th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya. It contains an account of the discussion between the Buddha and Sangārava brāhmana of Candalakappa. See Sangārava. M.ii.209ff.<br>2. Sangārava Sutta. An account of the visit of the Buddha and Ananda to Sangārava brāhmana of Sāvatthi. Sangārava explains to the Buddha that he washes away his faults by bathing morning and evening. The Buddha says that the only true purification is through the Dhamma. S.i.182f.<br>3. Sangārava Sutta. The Buddha explains to Sangārava that mantras learnt at a time when the heart is possessed by sensual lust, malevolence, sloth and torpor, excitement and flurry, doubt and wavering, are easily forgotten; as is the case of a man who tries to see his reflection in a bowl of water, either mixed with some dye, or heated on the fire, or overspread with mossy grass, or ruffled by the wind, or muddied and set in the dark. The cultivation of the seven bojjhaṅga will remove these disadvantages. S.v.121ff.; cf. No. 5 below.<br>4. Sangārava Sutta. Sangārava visits the Buddha and states that a brahmin is of more use than a Paribbājaka because he not only performs sacrifices himself, but makes others do likewise. The Buddha says that the appearance of a Tathāgata in the world is of benefit to many beings. Ananda asks Sangārava which of the two practices appears to him the simpler and of greater profit. Sangārava evades a straight answer, even though asked three times. The Buddha then tells him of the marvels of iddhi, ādesanā and anusāsanā possessed by monks, and describes them in detail. Sangārava admits that the ādesanā pātihāriya appeals moist to him. The Buddha tells him that numerous monks in the Order possess all three marvels. A.i.168ff.<br>5. Sangārava Sutta. Sangārava visits the Buddha and questions him on the power of remembering mantras. Same as No. 3 above. A.iii.230f.<br>6. Sangārava Sutta. The Buddha tells Sangārava, in answer to a question, that wrong view, wrong thinking, speech, action, living, effort, mindfulness, concentration, knowledge and release, are the ”hither shore” and their opposites the ”further shore.” A.v.232f.<br>7. Sangārava Sutta. The Buddha tells Sangārava that taking life, theft, wrong sexual conduct, falsehood, spiteful and bitter speech, idle babble, coveting, harmfulness, wrong view, are the ”hither shore” and abstention from these is the ”further shore.” A.v.252f.'],

On seeing her, the Thera repeated: ”Alas! this world suffers, bound in bonds of craving,” and with this as his incentive, he developed insight and won arahantship. Seeing his companion cherish wrong thoughts, the Thera admonished him in a verse, (Thag.vs.109) and he, too, became an arahant.<br>Ninety four kappas ago, Sangharakkhita saw seven Pacceka Buddhas at the foot of a rock and offered them kadamba flowers.

Then, seeing that his audience wished for more, he asked Sāriputta to continue the preaching while he himself rested. Sāriputta therefore preached the Sangīti Sutta, at the end of which the Buddha expressed his great appreciation of Sāriputta’s exposition.<br>This sutta, like the Dasuttara, is arranged in a new plan - which is regularly followed in the Anguttara Nikāya - of grouping the points or chief items brought forward, numerically, in arithmetical progression - in this case 1 to 10.

As the time approached for the Buddha to leave Tāvatimsa ,Moggallāna (Anuruddha, according to SNA.ii.570; cf. Vsm., p.391) announced his coming return to the multitude, who had been waiting at Sāvatthi, fed by Culla Anāthapindika, while Moggallāna expounded the Dhamma. They then made their way to Sankassa.<br>The descent of the Buddha took place on the day of the Mahāpavāraṇa festival. Sakka provides three ladders for the Buddha’s descent from Sineru. to the earth: on the right was a ladder of gold for the gods; on the left a silver ladder for Mahā Brahmā and his retinue; and in the middle a ladder of jewels for the Buddha. The assembled people covered the earth for thirty leagues round. There was a clear view of the nine Brahma worlds above and of Avīci below. The Buddha was accompanied by Pañcasikha, Mātali, Mahā Brahmā and Suyāma. Sāriputta was the first to welcome him (followed by Uppalavannā, SNA.ii.570), and the Buddha preached the Law, starting with what was within the comprehension even of a puthujjana, and ending with what only a Buddha could understand.<br>On this occasion was preached the Parosahassa Jātaka to proclaim to the multitude the unparalleled wisdom of Sāriputta (DhA.iii.224ff.; see also SNA.ii.570). It is said’ that the Buddha’s descent to Sankassa had provided opportunity for Moggallāna to show his eminence in iddhi, Anuruddha in dibbacakkhu, and Punna in skill in preaching, and the Buddha wished to give Sāriputta a chance of shining in his wisdom. (Ibid., loc. cit.; J.iv.266; see also Jhānasodhana, Sarabhamiga, and Candābha Jātakas). He therefore asked of Sāriputta questions which no one else could answer. The opening words of the Sāriputta Sutta are supposed to refer to this descent from Tusita (sic).<br>The site of the city gate of Sankassa is one of the ”unchangeable” spots of the world (avijahitatthānam). All Buddhas descend at that spot to the world of men after preaching the Abhidhamma (BuA.106, 247; MA.i.371, etc.). From Sankassa the Buddha went to Jetavana (J.i.193).<br>A shrine was erected on the spot where the Buddha’s right foot first touched the ground at Sankassa (DhA.iii.227). When the Chinese pilgrims,Hiouen Thsang and Fa Hien, visited the place, they found three ladders, which had been built of brick and stone by the ancients, to commemorate the Buddha’s descent, but the ladders were nearly sunk in the earth. (Beal, op. cit., i.203; Fa Hien, p.24).<br>There was, in the Buddha’s time, a deer park at Sankassa whereSuhemanta Thera heard the Buddha preach (ThagA.i.212). During the Vajjiputta controversy, Revata Thera, on his way from Soreyya toSahājāti, went through Sankassa. The road he took passed through Sankassa, Kannakujja,Udumbarā and Aggālapura (Vin.ii.299f).<br>Sankassa is now identified with Sankissa Basantapura on the north bank of the Ikkhumatī (Kālīnadī), between Atranji and Kanoj, twenty-three miles west of Fatehgarh and forty five north of Kanoj.'],

He entered the Order under them, attained arahantship, and died while yet young. Having heard no news of his son for some time, Sankha was alarmed and went to Benares in search of him. There, after enquiry, he heard of his son’s death as a Pacceka Buddha, and was shown the shrine erected in his memory. Sankha weeded the grass round the shrine, sprinkled sand, watered it, scattered wild flowers round it, and raised aloft his robe as banner over it. He then planted his parasol over the top and departed.<br>The Buddha related the story to the monks at Rājagaha, after his return from Vesāli, to explain the unparalleled honours he had received during the journey. Because he had uprooted the grass round Susīma’s shrine, a road of eight leagues was prepared for him to journey comfortably; because he had spread sand, his route was also so spread; because he had scattered flowers, his route was covered with flowers; because he had sprinkled water, there was a shower in Vesāli on his arrival; because he had raised a banner and set up a parasol, the whole cakkavāḷa was gay with flags and parasols.

There Duyyodhana frequently visited him; finding this inconvenient, the ascetic went to Mahimsakarattha and lived in a hut on a bend of the Kannapennā River, which flows from the Sankhapāla Lake near Mount Candaka. There he was visited by the Nāga king Sankhapāla, to whom he preached the Dhamma. Later, Duyyodhana discovered the whereabouts of the ascetic and visited him. There he saw the Nāga-king, and, impressed by his great magnificence, desired to visit the Nāga-world. On his return to the capital, Duyyodhana engaged in works of merit, and was born after death in the Nāga world and became its king under the name of Sankhapāla. In course of time, he grew weary of his magnificence, and, leaving the Nāga world, lived near the Kannapennā, on an ant hill, keeping the holy fast. As he lay there, sixteen men, roaming in the forest, saw him and seized him. They drove stakes into his body, and made holes in the stakes and fastened ropes to them in order to drag him along. But Sankhapāla showed no resentment. A landowner of Mithilā, called Alāra, saw him being ill treated and had him released. Thereupon, Sankhapāla invited Alāra to the Nāga world, and Alāra lived there for one year. He later became an ascetic, and, in due course, visited Benares, where he told the king the story of his visit to the Nāga world.

'saṅkhāra':['This term has, according to its context, different shades of meaning, which should be carefully distinguished.<br>(I) To its most frequent usages (s. foll. 1-4) the general term ’formation’ may be applied, with the qualifications required by the context. This term may refer either to the act of ’forming or to the passive state of ’having been formed’ or to both.<br>1. As the 2nd link of the formula of dependent origination, (paticcasamuppāda), saṅkhāra has the active aspect, ’forming, and signifies karma, i.e. wholesome or unwholesome volitional activity (cetanā) of body (kāya-saṅkhāra), speech (vacī-saṅkhāra) or mind (citta- or mano-saṅkhāra).This definition occurs, e.g. at S.XII.2, 27. For saṅkhāra in this sense, the word ’karma-formation’ has been coined by the author. In other passages, in the same context, saṅkhāra is defined by reference to<br>(a) meritorious karma-formations (puññ’ābhisaṅkhāra), (b) demeritorious k. (apuññ’abhisaṅkhāra), (c) imperturbable k. (āneñj’ābhisaṅkhāra), e.g. in S.XII.51; D.33. This threefold division covers karmic activity in all spheres of existence: the meritorious karma-formations extend to the sensuous and the fine-material sphere, the demeritorious ones only to the sensuous sphere, and the ’imperturbable’ only to the immaterial sphere.<br>2. The aforementioned three terms, kāya-, vacī- and citta-saṅkhāraare sometimes used in quite a different sense, namely as<br>(1) bodily function, i.e. in-and-out-breathing (e.g. M.10), (2) verbal function, i.e. thought-conception and discursive thinking, (3) mental-function, i.e. feeling and perception (e.g. M.44). See nirodhasamāpatti.3. It also denotes the 4th group of existence (saṅkhārakkhandha),and includes all ’mental formations’ whether they belong to ’karmically forming’ consciousness or not. See khandha,Tab.II. and S.XXII.56, 79.<br>4. It occurs further in the sense of anything formed (saṅkhata) and conditioned, and includes all things whatever in the world, all phenomena of existence. This meaning applies, e.g. to the well-known passage, ”All formations are impermanent... subject to suffering” (sabbe saṅkhāra aniccā ... dukkhā). In that context, however, s. is subordinate to the still wider and all-embracing term dhamma (thing); fordhamma includes also the Unformed or Unconditioned Element (asaṅkhata-dhātu),i.e. Nibbāna (e.g. in sabbe dhammā anattā, ”all things are without a self”).<br>(II) Sankhāra also means sometimes ’volitional effort’, e.g. in the formula of the roads to power (iddhi-pāda); in sasaṅkhāra- and asaṅkhāra-parinibbāyī (s. anāgāmī); and in the Abhidhamma terms asankhārika- and sasankhārika-citta,i.e. without effort = spontaneously, and with effort = prompted.<br>In Western literature, in English as well as in German, saṅkhārais sometimes mistranslated by ’subconscious tendencies’ or similarly (e.g Prof Beckh: ”unterbewußte Bildekräfte,” i.e. subconscious formative forces). This misinterpretation derives perhaps from a similar usage in non-Buddhist Sanskrit literature, and is entirely inapplicable to the connotations of the term in Pāli Buddhism, as listed above under I, 1-4. For instance, within the dependent origination, s. is neither subconscious nor a mere tendency, but is a fully conscious and active karmic volition. In the context of the 5 groups of existence (s. above I, 3), a very few of the factors from the group of mental formations (saṅkhārakkhandha) are also present as concomitants of subconsciousness (s. Tab.I,Tab.II, Tab.III), but are of course not restricted to it, nor are they mere tendencies.'],

'sankicca':['1. Sankicca TheraHe was born in a very eminent brahmin family of Sāvatthi. His mother died just before his birth and was cremated, but he was found unburnt on the funeral pyre (Cf. the story of Dabba). The men who burnt his mother’s body, turning the pyre over with sticks, pierced the womb and injured the pupil of the child’s eye. Hence his name (Sankunā chinnakkhikotitāya = Sankicco). When he was discovered, they consulted soothsayers, who told them that if he lived in the household seven generations would be impoverished, but if he became a monk he would be the leader of five hundred. At the age of seven he came to know of his mother’s death and expressed a wish to join the Order. His guardians agreeing to this, he was ordained under Sāriputta. He won arahantship in the Tonsure hall (ThagA.i.533).<br>At that time, thirty men of Sāvatthi, who had entered the Order and had practised the duties of higher ordination for four years, wished to engage in meditation. The Buddha, foreseeing danger for them, sent them to Sāriputta. Sāriputta advised them to take with them the novice Sankicca, and they reluctantly agreed. After a journey of one hundred and twenty leagues, they came to a village of one thousand families, where they stayed at the request of the inhabitants, who provided all their needs. At the beginning of the rains, the monks agreed among themselves not to talk to one another; if any among them fell ill, he was to strike a bell. One day, as the monks were eating their meal on the banks of a neighbouring river, a poor man who had travelled far stood near them and they gave him some food. He then decided to stay with them, but after two months, wishing to see his daughter, he left the monks without a word. He travelled through a forest where lived five hundred robbers, who had vowed to offer a human sacrifice to a spirit of the forest.<br>As soon as they saw him, they captured him and prepared for the sacrifice. The man then offered to provide them with a victim of far higher status than himself, and led them to the monks. Knowing their habits, he struck the bell and they all assembled. When the robbers made known their design, each one of the monks offered himself as a victim, and in the end Sankicca, with great difficulty, persuaded the others to let him go. The thieves took Sankicca, and, when all was ready, the leader approached him with drawn sword. Sankicca entered into samādhi, and when the blow was struck, the sword buckled and bent at the end and split from hilt to top. Marvelling at this, the thieves did obeisance to Sankicca, and, after listening to his preaching, asked leave to be ordained. Sankicca agreed to this, and, having ordained them, took them to the other monks. There he took leave of them and went with his following to the Buddha. In due course, Sankicca received the higher ordination, and ten years later he ordained his sister’s son, Atimuttaka (Adhimuttaka), who, likewise, ordained five hundred thieves. DhA.ii.240ff.; for the story of Atimuttaka see Sankicca’s story is often referred to - e.g., Vsm.313; J.vi.14.<br>The Nāgapeta Vatthu contains a story of another of Sankicca’s pupils (PvA.53ff). The Theragāthā (Thag. vs. 597-607) contains a series of stanzas spoken by Sankicca in praise of the charms of the forest in reply to a layman who, wishing to wait upon him, wished him to dwell in the village.<br>Sankicca is one of the four novices mentioned in the Catusāmanera Vatthu. Sankicca’s iddhi is described as ñāvavipphāra iddhi. (Ps.ii.211; BuA.24). The iddhi referred to in this connection is Sankicca’s escape from death while his mother’s body was being burnt.

The woman came on the stage and sang and danced, but she had fasted for seven days to acquire more grace of body, and, as she danced, she fell down dead. Santati was overwhelmed with a mighty sorrow, and straightway became sober. He then sought the Buddha for consolation in his grief. The Buddha preached a four line stanza, and Santati attained arahantship and asked the Buddha’s permission to pass intoNibbāna. The Buddha agreed, on condition that he rose into the air and told to the assembled people the story of his past life. Santati agreed to this, and, rising to a height of seven palm trees, related the meritorious deed of his past life.<br>Ninety kappas ago, in the time of Vipassī Buddha, he was a householder of Bandhumatī, and became a follower of the Buddha and went about proclaiming the virtues of the Three Refuges.

This so distressed him that he was about to commit suicide, when, inward vision suddenly expanding, he attained arahantship (Thag. vs. 405 10. ThagA.i.448f). According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.ii.256f), he tried to kill himself by making a snake, caught by the monks, bite him. But the snake refused to bite, in spite of all efforts to provoke him. Sappadāsa then threw it away, thinking it to be non poisonous. But the other monks declared it was a cobra, because they had seen its hood and heard its hissing.<br>Sappadāsa acted as barber to the monastery, and, one day, taking a razor, he applied it to his windpipe as he leaned against a tree. And then he thought how blameless his life had been and was filled with joy. Thereupon he developed insight and became an arahant. When the monks reported this to the Buddha, the Buddha said that the snake had been the Elder’s slave in his third previous life, and therefore did not dare bite him. This incident gave the monk his name, Sappadāsa.'],

After the Buddha’s departure, the Paribbājakas taunted and abused Sarabha (A.i.185ff).<br>It is said (AA.i.412 f ) that Sarabha joined the Order at the request of the Paribbājakas. They had failed to find any fault with the Buddha’s life, and thought that his power was due to an ”āvattanīmāyā,” which he and his disciples practised once a fortnight behind closed doors. Sarabha agreed to find it out and learn it. He therefore went to Gijjhakūta, where he showed great humility to all the resident monks. An Elder, taking pity on him, ordained him. In due course he learned the pātimokkha, which, he realized, was what the Paribbājakas took to be the Buddha’s ”māyā.” Having learned it, he went back to the Paribbājakas, taught it to them, and with them went about in the city boasting that he knew the Buddha’s teaching and had found it worthless.'],

'sarabhaṅga jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once born as the son of the purohita of the king of Benares. He was called Jotipāla because, on the day of his birth, there was a blaze of all kinds of arms for a distance of twelve leagues round Benares. This showed that he would be the chief archer of all India.<br>After having been educated in Takkasilā, he returned to Benares and entered the king’s service, receiving one thousand a day. When the king’s attendants grumbled at this, the king ordered Jotipāla to give an exhibition of his skill. This he did, in the presence of sixty thousand archers. With the bow and arrow he performed twelve unrivalled acts of skill and cleft seven hard substances. Then he drove an arrow through a furlong of water and two furlongs of earth and pierced a hair at a distance of half a furlong. The sun set at the conclusion of this exhibition, and the king promised to appoint him commander in chief the next day. But during the night, Jotipāla felt a revulsion for the household life, and, departing unannounced, went into the Kapitthavana on the Godhāvarī and there became an ascetic. On Sakka’s orders, Vissakamma built a hermitage for him, in which he lived, developing great iddhi powers. When his parents and the king with his retinue visited him, he converted them to the ascetic life, and his followers soon numbered many thousands.<br>He had seven pupils - Sālissara, Mendissara, Pabbata, Kāladevala, Kisavaccha, Anusissa and Nārada. When Kapitthavana became too crowded, Jotipāla, now known as Sarabhaṅga, sent his pupils away to different parts of the country: Sālissara to Lambacūlaka, Mendissara to Sātodikā, Pabbata to Añjana Mountain, Kāladevala to Ghanasela, Kisavaccha to Kumbhavatī and Nārada to Arañjara, while Anusissa remained with him. When Kisavaccha, through the folly of a courtesan, was ill treated by King Dandakī of Kumbhavatī and his army, Sarabhaṅga heard from the king’s commander in chief of this outrage and sent two of his pupils to bring Kisavaccha on a palanquin to the hermitage. There he died, and when his funeral was celebrated, for the space of half a league round his pyre there fell a shower of celestial flowers.<br>Because of the outrage committed on Kisavaccha, sixty leagues of Dandakī’s kingdom were destroyed together with the king. When the news of this spread abroad, three kings - Kalinga, Atthaka and Bhimaratha - recalling stories of other similar punishments that had followed insults to holy men, went to visit Sarabhaṅga in order to get at the truth of the matter. They met on the banks of the Godhāvarī, and there they were joined by Sakka. Sarabhaṅga sent Anusissa to greet them and offer them hospitality, and, when they had rested, gave them permission to put their questions. Sarabhaṅga explained to them how Dandaka, Nālikira, Ajjuna and Kalābu, were all born in hell owing to their ill-treatment of holy men, and went to expound to them the moral law. Even as he spoke the three kings were filled with the desire for reṇunciation, and at the end of Sarabhaṅga’s discourse they became ascetics, under him.<br>The story was told in reference to the death of Moggallāna. It is said that after Moggallāna had been attacked by brigands and left by them for dead, he recovered consciousness, and, flying to the Buddha, obtained his consent to die. The six deva worlds were filled with great commotion, and, after his death, the devas brought offerings of flowers and incense to his pyre, which was made of sandalwood and ninety nine precious things. When the body was placed on the pyre flowers rained down for the space of one league round and for seven days there was a great festival. The Buddha had the relics collected and deposited in a shrine in Veluvana.<br>The Buddha identified Moggallāna, with Kisavaccha and related this Jātaka.

One day, the Hare, observing the approach of the full moon, told his friends that the next day would be a fast day and that they must collect food and give it to any beggar who approached them. The animals all went out very early in the morning, one by one; the Otter found some fish buried in the sand; the Jackal a dead lizard, some meat, and a pot of curds; and the Monkey some fruits; and, finding that nobody appeared to claim them, each took them to his own dwelling. The Hare had only kusa grass, which he could not offer to anyone. He therefore decided to give his own body, and, because of this brave decision, Sakka’s throne was heated. Disguised as a brahmin, he came to test the Hare. He went first to the other animals in turn and they all offered him what they had. He then approached the Hare, whom he asked for food. The Hare asked him to collect faggots from the wood and make a fire. Then, telling the brahmin that he would give him his own body, without the brahmin having the necessity of killing him, he shook out any animals which might lurk in his fur, and then jumped into the fire as into a lotusbed. By the power of Sakka, the fire remained as cool as snow, and Sakka revealed his identity. Then, so that the Hare’s nobility might be known to all the world, he took some essence of the Himālaya and painted the form of a hare in the moon, to remain there during this whole kappa.

In the evening they bathed, and the Bodhisatta ate without offering Satadhamma anything. The latter had expected to be asked again and was very hungry.

On his way home, having earned seven hundred pieces, the brahmin opened his bag, and after having eaten some of the food, went to a stream to drink, leaving the bag open. A snake crept into the bag and lay there. A tree sprite, thinking to warn the brahmin, said, ”If you stop on the way you will die, if you return home your wife will die,” and then disappeared. Much alarmed, the brahmin went towards Benares, weeping along the way, and, as it was the fast day, people going to hear Senaka, directed the brahmin to him. Senaka, hearing the brahmin’s story, guessed the truth, and had the bag opened in front of the people. The snake crept out and was seized. To show his gratitude, the brahmin gave Senaka his seven hundred pieces, but Senaka gave them back with another three hundred, warning the brahmin not to take the money home. He buried the money under a tree, but could not keep the secret from his wife. She told her lover, and the money was stolen. The brahmin again sought Senaka, who told him of a plan for discovering the lover, and when he was found, Senaka sent for him and made him confess his guilt.<br>The story was related in reference to the Buddha’s wisdom.

The others then implored his assistance and compassion. He divided them into seven groups of one hundred each, and shouted to them, above the tempest, the Five Precepts, assuring them that their sīla would bring them to a happy dawn. They took the precepts as the waters rose, and were reborn in Sakka’s heaven, in different groups, each with his own vimāna. Their teacher had a golden vimāna of one hundred leagues in the middle of the others.

In the other conversation, Nārada, present at the discussion, in the company of Ananda, requests that the same questions be put to him.

Sāgata was endowed with supernatural power, and the overseers, who went to visit the Buddha atGijjhakūta, were very impressed by his iddhi, so much so that even while the Buddha was preaching they could not take their eyes off him. The king thereupon asked Sāgata to show them a greater marvel, and Sāgata, having shown in the open sky wonders of various kinds, fell at the Buddha’s feet and declared the Buddha his teacher (Vin.i.179 f).<br>Later, when the Buddha went to stay in Bhaddavatikā, having heard men warn the Buddha of the proximity of a Nāga of great power in the Jatila hermitage at Ambatittha, Sāgata went there and lived in the Nāga’s abode. The Nāga showed great resentment, but Sāgata overpowered him with his iddhi and then returned to Bhaddavatikā. From there he went with the Buddha to Kosambī, where the lay disciples, hearing of his wondrous feat, paid him great honour. When they asked what they could do for his comfort, he remained silent, but the Chabbaggīyā suggested that they should provide him with white spirits (kāpotikā).<br>The next day, when Sāgata went for alms, he was invited to various houses, where the inmates plied him with intoxicating drinks. So deep were his potations that on his way out of the town he fell prostrate at the gateway. The monks carried him, and at the monastery they laid him down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, but he turned round so that his feet lay towards the Buddha. The Buddha pointed out his condition to the monks, using it as an example of the evil effects of liquor; and he made this the occasion for the passing of a rule against the use of alcohol. Vin.iv.108f.; the story: is also given as the introduction to the Surāpāna Jātaka (J.i.360 ff.) which, too, was preached on this occasion; cf.

There the Buddha and his monks were entertained to a meal, at the end of which the Buddha preached the Jarā Sutta. Both the brahmin and his wife became Sakadāgāmins.<br>When the Buddha returned to Añjanavana, the monks asked him what the brahmin had meant by calling him his son.

The Bodhisatta explained to Kosiyagotta why he carried the corn away - to feed his parents, his young ones, and those who were in need, thus, as it were, paying a debt, giving a loan, and setting up a store of merit.

'sāma jātaka':['Once two hunters, chiefs of villages, made a pact that if their children happened to be of different sexes, they should marry each other. One had a boy called Dukūlaka, because he was born in a wrapping of fine cloth; the other had a daughter called Pārikā, because she was born beyond the river. When they grew up the parents married them, but, because they had both come from the Brahma world, they agreed not to consummate the marriage. With their parents’ consent they became ascetics, and lived in a hermitage provided for them by Sakka on the banks of the Migasammatā. Sakka waited on them, and perceiving great danger in store for them, persuaded them to have a son. The conception took place by Dukūlaka touching Pārikā’s navel at the proper time. When the son was born they called him Sāma, and, because he was of golden colour, he came to be called Suvannasāma. He was the Bodhisatta.<br>One day, after Sāma was grown up, his parents, returning from collecting roots and fruits in the forest, took shelter under a tree on an anthill. The water which dripped from their bodies angered a snake living in the anthill, and his venomous breath blinded them both. When it grew late Sāma went in search of them and brought them home. From then onwards he looked after them.<br>Piliyakkha, king of Benares, while out hunting one day, leaving his mother in charge of the kingdom, saw Sāma drawing water, and, lest he should escape, shot at him with his arrow. The king took him for some supernatural being, seeing that the deer, quite fearless, drank of the water while Sāma was filling his jar.<br>When Piliyakkha heard who Sāma was and of how he was the mainstay of his parents, he was filled with grief. Sāma fell down fainting from the poisoned arrow, and the king thought him dead. A goddess, Bahusodarī, who had been Sāma’s mother seven births earlier, lived in Gandhamādana and kept constant watch over him. This day she had gone to an assembly of the gods and had forgotten him for a while, but she suddenly became aware of the danger into which he had fallen. She stood in the air near Piliyakkha, unseen by him, and ordered him to go and warn Sāma’s parents. He did as he was commanded, and, having revealed his identity, gradually informed them of Sāma’s fate and his own part in it. But neither Dukūlaka nor Pārikā spoke to him one word of resentment. They merely asked to be taken to where Sāma’s body lay. Arrived there, Pārikā made a solemn Act of Truth (saccakiriyā), and the poison left Sāma’s body, making him well.<br>Bahusodarī did likewise in Gandhamādana, and Sāma’s parents regained their sight. Then Sāma preached to the marvelling king, telling him how even the gods took care of those who cherished their parents.<br>The story was told in reference to a young man of Sāvatthi. Having heard the Buddha preach, he obtained his parents’ leave with great difficulty and joined the Order. Five years he lived in the monastery, and, failing to attain insight, he returned to the forest and strove for twelve years more. His parents grew old, and as there was no one to look after them, their retainers robbed them of their goods. Their son, hearing of this from a monk who visited him in the forest, at once left his hermitage and returned to Sāvatthi. There he tended his parents, giving them food and clothing which he acquired by begging, often starving himself that they might eat. Other monks blamed him for supporting lay folk, and the matter was reported to the Buddha. But the Buddha, hearing his story, praised him and preached to him the Mātuposaka Sutta (q.v.).<br>Dukūlaka is identified with Kassapa, Pārikā with Bhaddā Kāpilānī, Piliyakkha with Ananda, Sakka with Anuruddha, and Bahusodarī with Uppalavannā (J.vi.68 95; the story is referred to at Mil.198f.; J.iv.90, etc.; see also Mtu.ii.212 ff).<br>The Sālikedāra Jātaka was preached in reference to the same monk.'],

There was a lotus pond in the village (A.iii.309).<br>The Vedhaññā probably lived there, because, according to thePāsādika Sutta (D.iii.117), the Buddha was in the mango grove of the Vedhañña Sākiyans when the news, as given in the Sāmagāma Sutta, of Nigantha Nātaputta’s death, was brought to him.<br>According to Buddhaghosa (MA.ii.829) the village was called Sāmagāma, Sāmakānam ussanattā.<br>1. Sāmagāma Sutta. While the Buddha is at Sāmagāma, news is brought to Ananda by Cunda Samanuddesa of the death of Nigantha Nātaputta at Pāvā, and of the division of his followers into two factions engaged in fighting each other. Amanda gives the news to the Buddha, who asks if there be any difference of opinion among monks regarding the Buddha’s teaching. ”No,” answers Ananda, but adds that such differences may arise after the Buddha’s death. The Buddha says that quarrels regarding rigours of regimen or of the Vinaya are of little concern. It is quarrels regarding the Path or the course of training that are really important. He then explains the six causes from which disputes grow, the four adjudications (adhikarana) regarding disputes, and the seven settlements of adjudication - by giving a summary verdict in the presence of the parties, a verdict of innocence, of past insanity; confession may be admitted; a chapter’s decision may be taken; there is also specific wickedness and there is covering up. Then there are six things which lead to conciliations: acts of love, words of love, sharing equally whatever gifts one receives, strict practice of virtue without flaw or blemish, and the holding of noble views which make for salvation (M.ii.243 51; cf. thePāsadika Sutta).<br>Buddhaghosa adds (MA.ii.840) that, while in theKosambiya Sutta the Sotāpattimagga is called sammāditthi, in this sutta, Sotāpattiphala itself is so called.<br>2 Sāmagāma Sutta. The Buddha was once staying near the lotus pond at Sāmagāma and late at night is visited by a deva. After saluting the Buddha, he states that there are three things which lead to a monk’s failure:<br>delight in worldly activity delight in talk delight in sleepSo saying, he departs. The next day the Buddha relates to the monks the Deva’s statement and adds three other things which lead to failure:<br>delight in company evil speaking friendship with bad men. A.iii.309f.'],

Ajātasattu, accompanied by Jīvaka, visits the Buddha at Jīvaka’sAmbavana and questions him on the fruits of recluse ship, wherefore men join the Buddha’s Order. The Buddha answers and includes in his answer his justification for the foundation of the Order, for the enunciation of the Vinaya, and the practical rules by which life in the Order is regulated.<br>The sutta also contains a list of ordinary occupations followed by people in the Buddha’s day, which forms interesting reading.<br>In the introductory story, Ajātasattu explains that he has already put the question to the founders of six other Orders:<br>Pūrana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Nigantha Nātaputta Sañjaya Belatthiputta. But these teachers, instead of answering his questions, give a general statement of their theories.<br>The summaries given here of their teachings are of great interest, because they form some sort of evidence, at least, as to the speculations favoured by them. By means of a counter question, the Buddha finds from Ajātasattu that even if a servant of his joined the Order, he would receive the king’s honour and respect. Then the Buddha proceeds to show, step by step, the fruits higher and nobler, which await the samana, immediate in their effect, culminating in the six fold abhiññā of the arahant. The king is greatly impressed, takes refuge in the Buddha, and expresses his remorse for having killed his father. The Buddha utters no word of blame, but after the departure of the king, he informs the monks that if Ajātasattu had not been guilty of patricide he would have realized the first fruit of the Path (D.i.47 86).<br>The Commentary adds (DA.i.238) that as a result of hearing this discourse, Ajātasattu would, in the future, become a Pacceka Buddha named Viditavisesa. From this moment, Ajātasattu was one of the Buddha’s most devoted followers. It is said that, after his father’s death, Ajātasattu could never sleep at night until he had heard the Buddha, after which he enjoyed peaceful sleep.'],

The monks took up their residence in the Pupphārāma in Sirivaddhanapura (Kandy), and, under the king’s patronage, the ceremony of ordination was held on the 2296th year after the Buddha’s death, on the full moon day of Ashālha.<br>Some time later, Dhammika again sent a chapter led by Visuddhācariya and Varañānamuni. As a token of his gratitude, Kittisirirājasīha sent to Dhammika a model of the Buddha’s Tooth Relic in Kandy, together with various other gifts. Dhammika returned his courtesy by sending various books not to be found in Ceylon, a replica of the Buddha’s footprint found on the Saccabaddha Mountain, etc. Cv.c.63ff., 136 ff.'],
'sānu sutta':['Contains the conversation between Sānu’s mother and the Yakkhinī, who possessed Sānu (see Sānu) in order to prevent him from ”losing his soul.” Sānu’s mother says she cannot understand how Yakkhas can possess holy men who keep the fasts and lead holy lives. The Yakkhinī says she is right; but holiness consists in refraining from evil, both open and secret. Sānu’s mother understands, and, when her son regains consciousness and asks her why she weeps as he is not dead, she replies that he is as good as dead in that he wishes to return to the household life, like goods, which having been rescued from the fire, wish to be thrown into it once more. S.i.208f.'],
'sānu thera':['He was born in a family of Sāvatthi after his father had left home for the ascetic life. The mother, naming him Sānu, took him at the age of seven to the monks for ordination, thinking thus to ensure for him supreme happiness. He was known as Sānu (Sānu Sāmanera) the Novice, and became a very learned teacher of the doctrine, practising the meditation of love (mettā), and was popular among gods and men.<br>His mother in a previous birth was a Yakkha. Later, Sānu lost his intellectual discernment and grew distraught and longed to go roaming. His former Yakkha mother seeing this, warned his human mother as described in the Sānu Sutta (q.v.). The latter was overwhelmed with grief, and, when Sānu visited her, he found her weeping. She told him that he was as good as dead in that he had rejected the Buddha’s teaching and turned again to lower things, hence her sorrow. Sānu was filled with anguish, and, strengthening his insight, he soon won arahantship (ThagA.i.113f).<br>He is evidently identical with Udakadāyaka of the Apadāna (Ap.i.205). In the past, he saw Siddhattha Buddha having his meal and brought him water for his hands and feet and face and mouth. Sixty one kappas ago he was a king, named Vimala.<br>The story of Sānu is given also in the Samyutta and Dhammapada Commentaries (SA.i.235ff.; DhA.iv.18ff), but the details differ. There, Sānu’s human mother is portrayed as encouraging him to return to the lay life. His Yakkha-mother went to his human mother’s home, where Sānu was waiting for a meal, took possession of his body, twisted his neck, and felled him to the ground, where he lay foaming at the mouth. Sānu’s mother was filled with despair. The Yakkhinī then revealed herself and exhorted Sānu not to behave foolishly by disregarding the Buddha’s teaching. When he regained his senses, his human mother, too, pointed out the disadvantages of household life. When he declared his intention of not returning to lay life, she fed him with choice food and gave him a set of three robes that he might receive the upasampadā ordination. He then sought the Buddha, who urged him to fresh and streṇuous effort. Sānu was famous as a mighty teacher throughout Jambudīpa. He lived to one hundred and twenty years.'],

On being invited to the Sārandada cetiya, the Buddha went to them, and, having heard of their discussion, told them of five treasures much more rare in the world: the Tathāgata, his Dhamma, a person able to recognize the Dhamma in the world, one who follows it, and one who is grateful. A.iii.167 f.<br>2. Sārandada Sutta.

'sāriputta':['1. Sāriputta Thera. The chief disciple (aggasāvaka) of Gotama - Buddha. He is also called Upatissa, which was evidently his personal name (M.i.150). The commentators say that Upatissa was the name of his village and that he was the eldest son of the chief family in the village, but other accounts give his village as Nālaka. His father was the brahmin, Vaṅganta (DhA.ii.84), and his mother, Rūpasāri. It was because of his mother’s name that he came to be called Sāriputta. In Sanskrit texts his name occurs as Sāriputra, Sāliputra, Sārisuta, Sāradvatīputra. In the Apadāna (ii.480) he is also called Sārisambhava.<br>The name Upatissa is hardly ever mentioned in the books. He had three younger brothers - Cunda, Upasena, and Revata (afterwards called Khadiravaniya) - and three sisters - Cālā, Upacālā and Sisūpacālā; all of whom joined the Order. DhA.ii.188; cf. Mtu.iii.50; for details of them see s.v.; mention is also made of an uncle of Sāriputta and of a nephew, both of whom he took to the Buddha, thereby rescuing them from false views (DhA.ii.230 2); Uparevata was his nephew (SA.iii.175).<br>The story of Sāriputta’s conversion and the account of his past lives, which prepared him for his eminent position as the Buddha’s Chief Disciple, have been given under Mahā Moggallāna. Sāriputta had a very quick intuition, and he became asotāpanna immediately after hearing the first two lines of the stanza spoken by Assaji. After his attainment of sotāpatti, Kolita (Moggallāna) wished to go with him to Veluvana to see the Buddha, but Sāriputta, always grateful to his teachers, suggested that they should first seek their teacher, Sañjaya, to give him the good news and go with him to the Buddha. But Sañjaya refused to fall in with this plan. Moggallāna attained arahantship on the seventh day after his ordination, but it was not till a fortnight later that Sāriputta became an arahant. He was staying, at the time, with the Buddha, in the Sūkarakhatalena in Rājagaha, and he reached his goal as a result of hearing the Buddha preach the Vedānapariggaha Sutta to Dīghanakha. This account is summarized from DhA.i.73 ff.; AA.i.88 ff.; ThagA.ii.93 ff. Ap.i.15ff.; the story of their conversion is given at Vin.i.38ff.<br>In the assembly of monks and nuns, Sāriputta was declared by the Buddha foremost among those who possessed wisdom (etadaggam mahāpaññānam, A.i.23). He was considered by the Buddha as inferior only to himself in wisdom. SA.ii.45; his greatest exhibition of wisdom followed the Buddha’s descent from Tāvatimsa to the gates of Sankassa, when the Buddha asked questions of the assembled multitude, which none but Sāriputta could answer. But some questions were outside the range of any but a Buddha (DhA.iii.228 f.; cf. SNA.ii.570f.). Similarly knowledge of the thoughts and inclinations of people were beyond Sāriputta; only a Buddha possesses such knowledge (DhA.iii.426; J.i.182). Further, only a Buddha could find suitable subjects for meditation for everybody without error (SNA.i.18), and read their past births without limitation (SNA, ii.571).<br>The Buddha would frequently merely suggest a topic, and Sāriputta would preach a sermon on it in detail, and thereby win the Buddha’s approval. (See, e.g., M.i.13; iii.46, 55, 249). The Buddha is recorded as speaking high praise of him: ”Wise art thou, Sāriputta, comprehensive and manifold thy wisdom, joyous and swift, sharp and fastidious. Even as the eldest son of a Cakkavatti king turns the Wheel as his father hath turned it, so dost thou rightly turn the Wheel Supreme of the Dhamma, even as I have turned it.” (S.i.191; cf. SN.vs.556 f., where the Buddha is asked by Sela, who is his general, and the Buddha replies that it is Sāriputta who turns the Wheel of the Law; also M.iii.29). He thus came to be called Dhammasenāpati, just as Ananda was called Dhammabhandāgārika. The Anupada Sutta is one long eulogy of Sāriputta by the Buddha. He is there held up as the supreme example of the perfect disciple, risen to mastery and perfection in noble virtue, noble concentration, noble perception, noble deliverance. M.iii.25ff. In the Mahāgosinga Sutta Sāriputta expresses his view that that monk is beat who is master of his heart and is not mastered by it. The Buddha explains that Sāriputta was stating his own nature (M.i.215 f.). The Buddha did not, however, hesitate to blame Sāriputta when necessary e.g., the occasion when some novices, becoming noisy, were sent away by the Buddha, whose motive Sāriputta misunderstood (M.i.459). And again, when Sāriputta did not look after Rāhula properly, making it necessary for Rāhula to spend the whole night in the Buddha’s jakes (J.i.161f.).<br>In the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta (M.iii.248) he is compared to a mother teacher, while Moggallāna is like a child’s wet nurse; Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good. In the Pindapāta pārisuddhi Sutta (M.iii.294f) the Buddha commends Sāriputta for the aloofness of his life and instructs him in the value of reflection. Other instances are given of the Buddha instructing and examining him on various topics e.g., on bhūtam (”what has come to be”) (S.ii.47f), on the five indriyas, (S.v.220f., 225f., 233f ) and on sotāpatti. S.v.347; we find the Buddha also instructing him on the cultivation of tranquillity (A.i.65); on the destruction of ”I” and ”mine” (A.i.133); the reasons for failure and success in enterprises (A.ii.81f.); the four ways of acquiring personality (attabhāva) (A.ii.159); the methods of exhortation (A.iii.198); the acquisition of joy that comes through seclusion (A.iii.207); the noble training for the layman (211f.); six things that bring spiritual progress to a monk (424f.); seven similar things (A.iv.30); the seven grounds for praising a monk (35); the things and persons a monk should revere (120f.); the eight attributes of a monk free from the cankers (223 f.); the nine persons who, although they die with an attached remainder for rebirth, are yet free from birth in hell among animals and among petas (379 f.); and the ten powers of a monk who has destroyed the cankers (A.v.174 f.).<br>We also find instances of Sāriputta questioning his colleagues, or being questioned by them, on various topics. Thus he is questioned by Mahā Kotthita on kamma (S.ii.112 f.); and on yoniso manasikāra (progressive discipline, S.iii.176 f.); on avijjā and vijjā (ibid., 172 f.); on the fetters of sense perception (S.iv.162 f.); on certain questions pronounced by the Buddha as indeterminate (ibid., 384 f.); on whether anything is left remaining after the passionless ending of the six spheres of contact (A.ii.161); and on the purpose for which monks lead the brahmacariya under the Buddha (A.iv.382). The Mahāvedalla Sutta (M.i.292 ff.) records a long discourse preached by Sāriputta to Mahā Kotthita. He is mentioned as questioning Mahā Kassapa on the terms ātāpī and ottāpī (S.ii.195f.), and Anuruddha on sekha (S.v.174 f., 298f.). On another occasion, Anuruddha tells Sāriputta of his power of seeing the thousand fold world system, his unshaken energy, and his untroubled mindfulness. Sāriputta tells him that his deva sight is mere conceit, his claims to energy conceit, and his mindfulness just worrying, and exhorts him to abandon thoughts of them all. Anuruddha follows his advice and becomes an arahant. A.i.281f.<br>Moggallāna asks Sāriputta regarding the ”undefiled” (their conversation forms the Anaṅgana Sutta, M.i.25 ff.), and, at the conclusion of the Gulissāni Sutta, inquires whether the states of consciousness mentioned in that sutta were incumbent only on monks from the wilds or also on those from the villages (M.i.472f.). Sāriputta questions Upavāna regarding the bojjhangā (S.v.76), and is questioned by Ananda regarding sotāpatti (S.v.346, 362) as regards the reason why some beings are set free in this very life while others are not (A.ii.167), and on the winning of perfect concentration (A.v.8, 320). Ananda also questions Sāriputta (A.iii.201f.) on the speedy knowledge of aptness in things (kusaladhammesu khippanisanti), and, again, on how a monk may learn new doctrines and retain old ones without confusion (A.iii.361). In both these cases Sāriputta asks Ananda to answer the questions himself, and, at the end of his discourse, praises him. The Rathavinīta Sutta (M.i.145 ff.) records a conversation between Sāriputta and Punna Mantānīputta, for whom he had the greatest respect, after hearing the Buddha’s eulogy of him. Sāriputta had given instructions that he should be told as soon as Punna came to Sāvatthi and took the first opportunity of seeing him. Among others who held discussions with Sāriputta are mentioned Samiddhi (A.iv.385), Yamaka (S.iii.109f.), Candikāputta (A.iv.403), and Laludāyi (A.iv.414).<br>Among laymen who had discussions with Sāriputta are Atula (DhA.iii.327), Nakulapitā (S.iii.2f.) and Dhānañjāni (M.ii.186); Sīvalī (immediately after his birth; J.i.408), also the Paribbājakas, Jambukhādaka (S.iv.251f.), Sāmandaka (S.iv.261 f.; A.v.120), and Pasūra (SNA.ii.538), and the female Paribbājakas Saccā, Lolā, Avavādakā and Patācārā (J.iii.1), and Kundalakesī (DhA.ii.223f.). He is also said to have visited the Paribbājakas in order to hold discussion with them (A.iv.378); see also S.iii.238f., where a Paribbājaka consults him on modes of eating.<br>The care of the Sangha and the protection of its members’ integrity was Sāriputta’s especial concern by virtue of his position as the Buddha’s Chief Disciple. Thus we find him being sent with Moggallāna to bring back the monks who had seceded with Devadatta. His admonitions to the monks sometimes made him unpopular e.g., in the case of the Assaji Punaabbasukā, the Chabbaggiyā (who singled him out for special venom) and Kokālika (See Channa, who reviled both Sāriputta and Moggallāna, DhA.ii.110 f.). When Channa declared his intention of committing suicide, Sāriputta attempted to dissuade him, but without success (S.iv.55ff.; see also the Channovāda Sutta). Monks sought his advice in their difficulties. (See, e.g., S.iv.103, where a monk reports to him that a colleague has returned to the household life, and asks what he is to do about it). He was greatly perturbed by the dissensions of the monks of Kosambī, and consulted the Buddha, at length, as to what he could do about it (Vin.i.354). He was meticulous about rules laid down by the Buddha. Thus a rule had been laid down that one monk could ordain only one samanera, and when a boy was sent to him for ordination from a family which had been of great service to him, Sāriputta refused the request of the parents till the Buddha had rescinded the rule (Vin.i.83). Another rule forbade monks to eat garlic (lasuna), and when Sāriputta lay ill and knew he could be cured by garlic, even then he refused to eat them till permission was given by the Buddha for him to do so (Vin.ii.140). The Dhammapada Commentary (Vin.ii.140f) describes how, at the monastery in which Sāriputta lived, when the other monks had gone for alms, he made the round of the entire building, sweeping the un-swept places, filling empty vessels with water, arranging furniture, etc., lest heretics, coming to the monastery, should say: ”Behold the residences of Gotama’s pupils.” But even then he did not escape censure from his critics. A story is told (DhA.iv.184f) of how he was once charged with greed, and the Buddha himself had to explain to the monks that Sāriputta was blameless. While Sāriputta was severe in the case of those who failed to follow the Buddha’s discipline, he did not hesitate to rejoice with his fellow monks in their successes. Thus we find him congratulating Moggallāna on the joy he obtained from his iddhi powers, and praising his great attainments (praise which evoked equally generous counter praise), (S.ii.275 f ) and eulogising Anuruddha on his perfected discipline won through the practice of the four satipatthānas (S.v.301f). It was the great encouragement given by Sāriputta to Samitigutta (q.v.), when the latter lay ill with leprosy in the infirmary, which helped him to become an arahant. It was evidently the custom of Sāriputta to visit sick monks, as did the Buddha himself (ThagA.i.176). So great was Sāriputta’s desire to encourage and recognize merit in his colleagues that he once went about praising Devadatta’s iddhi powers, which made it difficult for him when later he had to proclaim, at the bidding of the Sangha, Devadatta’s evil nature (Vin.ii.189).<br>Several instances are given (E.g., S.ii.274; v.70; A.i.63; ii.160; iii.186, 190, 196, 200, 292, 340; iv.325, 328, 365; v.94, 102, 123, 315, 356f) of Sāriputta instructing the monks and preaching to them of his own accord on various topics - apart from the preaching of the well known suttas assigned to him. Sometimes these suttas were supplementary to the Buddha’s own discourses (E.g., M.i.13, 24, 184, 469). Among the most famous of Sāriputta’s discourses are the Dasuttara and the Sangīti Suttas (q.v.). Though Sāriputta was friendly with all the eminent monks surrounding the Buddha, there was very special affection between him and Ananda and also Moggallāna. We are told that this was because Amanda was the Buddha’s special attendant, a duty which Sāriputta would have been glad to undertake For details of this see Mahā Moggallāna, Ananda. Ananda himself had the highest regard and affection for Sāriputta. It is recorded in the Samyutta Nikāya (S.i.63) that once, when the Buddha asked Ananda, ”Do you also, Ananda, approve of our Sāriputta?” Amanda replied, ”Who, Sir, that is not childish or corrupt or stupid or of perverted mind, will not approve of him? Wise is he, his wisdom comprehensive and joyous and swift, sharp and fastidious. Small is he in his desires and contented; loving seclusion and detachment, of rampant energy. A preacher is he, accepting advice, a critic, a scourge of evil.”<br>Sāriputta was specially attached, also, to Rāhula, the Buddha’s son, who was entrusted to Sāriputta for ordination. Mention is made of a special sutta in the Majjhima Nikāya, (the Mahā Rāhulovāda Sutta; M.i.421f ) in which he urges Rāhula to practise the study of breathing. The special regard which Sāriputta had for the Buddha and Rāhula extended also to Rāhulamātā, for we find that when she was suffering from flatulence. Rāhula consulted Sāriputta, who obtained for her some mango juice, a known remedy for the disease. (J.ii.392f) On another occasion (J.ii.433) he obtained from Pasenadi rice mixed with ghee and with red fish for flavouring when Rāhulamātā suffered from some stomach trouble. Among laymen Sāriputta had special regard for Anāthapindika; when the latter lay ill he sent for Sāriputta, who visited him with Ananda and preached to him the Anāthapindikovāda Sutta. At the end of the discourse Anāthapindika said he had never before heard such a homily. Sāriputta said they were reserved for monks only, but Anāthapindika asked that they could be given to the laity and to young men of undimmed vision. Anāthapindika died soon after and was reborn in Tusita. M.iii.258 ff.; cf. S.v.380, which probably refers to an earlier illness of Anāthapindika. He recovered immediately after the preaching of Sāriputta’s sermon, and served Sāriputta with rice from his own cooking pot.<br>Sāriputta also, evidently, had great esteem for the householder Citta, for we are told (DhA.ii.74) that he once paid a special visit to Macchikāsanda to see him.<br>Several incidents are related in the books showing the exemplary qualities possessed by Sāriputta e.g., the stories of Tambadāṭhika, Punna and his wife, the poor woman in the Kundakakucchisindhava Jātaka and Losaka Tissa (q.v.). These show his great compassion for the poor and his eagerness to help them. Reference has already been made to his first teacher, Sañjaya, whom he tried, but failed, to convert to the Buddha’s faith. His second teacher was Assaji. It is said that every night on going to bed he would do obeisance to the quarter in which he knew Assaji to be and would sleep with his head in that direction. DhA.iv.150 f.; cf. SNA.i.328. If Assaji were in the same vihāra, Sāriputta would visit him immediately after visiting the Buddha. It was in connection with this that the Dhamma Sutta (q.v.) was preached.<br>The stories of the Sāmaneras Sukha and Pandita, and of the monk Rādhā, also show his gratitude towards any who had shown him favour (See also Vin.i.55 f). His extreme affection for and gratitude to the Buddha are shown in the Sampasādanīya Sutta (q.v.). That Sāriputta possessed great patience is shown by the story (DhA.iv.146f) of the brahmin who, to test his patience, struck him as he entered the city for alms. But when he was wrongly accused and found it necessary to vindicate his good name, he did not hesitate to proclaim his innocence at great length and to declare his pre eminence in virtue. (See, e.g., his ”lion’s roar” at A.iv.373ff). Another characteristic of Sāriputta was his readiness to take instruction from others, however modest. Thus one story relates how, in absent mindedness, he let the fold of his robe hang down. A novice said, ”Sir, the robe should be draped around you,” and Sāriputta agreed, saying, ”Good, you have done well to point it out to me,” and going a little way, he draped the robe round him (ThagA.ii.116). A quaint story is told (Ud.iv.4) of a Yakkha who, going through the air at night, saw Sāriputta wrapt in meditation, his head newly shaved. The sight of the shining head was a great temptation to the Yakkha, and, in spite of his companion’s warning, he dealt a blow on the Thera’s head. The blow was said to have been hard enough to shatter a mountain, but Sāriputta suffered only a slight headache afterwards.<br>Mention is made of two occasions on which Sāriputta fell ill. Once he had fever and was cured by lotus stalks which Moggallāna obtained for him from the Mandākinī Lake (Vin.i.214). On the other occasion he had stomach trouble, which was again cured by Moggallāna giving him garlic (lasuna), to eat which the rule regarding the use of garlic had to be rescinded by the Buddha (Vin.ii.140).<br>Sāriputta was fond of meal cakes (pitthakhajjaka), but finding that they tended to make him greedy he made a vow never to eat them (J.i.310).<br>Sāriputta died some months before the Buddha. It is true that the account of the Buddha’s death in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta ignores all reference to Sāriputta, though it does introduce him (D.ii.81 ff ) shortly before as uttering his ”lion’s roar” (sīhanāda), his great confession of faith in the Buddha, which, in the commentarial account, he made when he took leave of the Buddha to die. The Samyutta Nikāya (S.v.161) records that he died at Nālagāmaka (the place of his birth), and gives an eulogy of him pronounced by the Buddha after his death (S.v.163f).<br>There is no need to doubt the authenticity of this account. It merely states that when Sāriputta was at Nālagāmaka he was afflicted with a sore disease. His brother, Cunda Samanuddesa, was attending on him when he died. His body was cremated, and Cunda took the relics to Sāvatthi with Sāriputta’s begging bowl and outer robe. The relics were wrapped in his water-strainer. Cunda first broke the news to Ananda, who confessed that when he heard it his mind was confused and his body felt as though drugged. Cf. Thag.vs.1034; see also the eulogy of Sāriputta by Vangīsa during his lifetime (Thag.1231 3). Hiouen Thsang saw the stūpa erected over the relics of Sāriputta in the town of Kālapināka (Beal, op. cit., ii.177).<br>Together they sought the Buddha and told him of the event, and the Buddha pointed out to them the impermanence of all things.<br>The Commentaries give more details. The Buddha returned to Sāvatthi after his last vassa in Beluvagāma. Sāriputta sought him there, and, realizing that his death would come in seven days, he decided to visit his mother, for she, though the mother of seven arahants, had no faith in the Sangha. \[This was because all her children joined the Order and left her desolate in spite of the forty crores of wealth which lay in the house. It is said (DhA.iv.164f.) that when Sāriputta had gone home on a previous occasion, she abused both him and his companions roundly. Rāhula was also in the company.\] He therefore asked his brother, Cunda, to prepare for the journey to Nālagāmaka with five hundred others, and then took leave of the Buddha after performing various miracles and declaring his faith in the Buddha and uttering his ”lion’s roar.” A large concourse followed him to the gates of Sāvatthi, and there he addressed them and bade them stay behind. In seven days he reached Nālaka, where he wais met by his nephew, Uparevata, outside the gates. Him he sent on to warn his mother of his arrival with a large number of people. She, thinking that he had once more returned to the lay life, made all preparations to welcome him and his companions. Sāriputta took up his abode in the room in which he was born (jātovāraka). There he was afflicted with dysentery. His mother, unaware of this and sulking because she found he was still a monk, remained in her room. The Four Regent Gods and Sakka and Mahā Brahmā waited upon him. She saw them, and having found out who they were, went to her son’s room. There she asked him if he were really greater than all these deities, and, when he replied that it was so, she reflected on the greatness of her son and her whole body was suffused with joy. Sāriputta then preached to her, and she became a sotāpanna. Feeling that he had paid his debt to his mother, he sent Cunda to fetch the monks, and, on their arrival, he sat up with Cunda’s help and asked if he had offended them in any way during the forty four years of his life as a monk. On receiving their assurance that he had been entirely blameless, he wiped his lips with his robe and lay down, and, after passing through various trances, died at break of dawn.<br>His mother made all arrangements for the funeral, and Vissakamma assisted in the ceremony. When the cremation was over, Anuruddha extinguished the flames with perfumed water, and Cunda gathered together the relics. This account is summarized from SA.iii.172ff.; similar accounts are found at DA.ii.549f, etc. Sāriputta’s death is also referred to at J.i.391.<br>Among those who came to pay honour to the pyre was the goddess Revatī (q.v.). Sāriputta died on the full moon day of Kattika (October to November) preceding the Buddha’s death, and Moggallāna died a fortnight later. SA.iii.181; J.i.391; both Sāriputta and Moggallāna were older than the Buddha because they were born ”anuppanne yeva hi Buddhe” (DhA.i.73).<br>Sāriputta had many pupils, some of whom have already been mentioned. Among others were Kosiya, Kandhadinna, Cullasārī, Vanavāsika Tissa, Sankicca (q.v.), and Sarabhū, who brought to Ceylon the Buddha’s collar bone, which he deposited in the Mahiyaṅgana-cetiya (Mhv.i.37f). Sāriputta’s brother, Upavāna, predeceased him, and Sāriputta was with him when he died of snake bite at Sappasondikapabbāra (S.iv.40f).<br>Sāriputta’s special proficiency was in the Abhidhamma. It is said (DhSA.16f., DA.i.15, where it is said that at the end of the First Recital the Abhidhamma was given in charge of five hundred arahants, Sāriputta being already dead) that when preaching the Abhidhamma, to the gods of Tāvatimsa, the Buddha would visit Anotatta every day, leaving a nimitta Buddha, on Sakka’s throne to continue the preaching. After having bathed in the lake he would take his midday rest. During this time Sāriputta would visit him and learn from the Buddha all that had been preached of the Abhidhamma during the previous day. Having thus learnt the Abhidhamma, Sāriputta taught it to his five hundred pupils. Their acquirement of the seven books of the Abhidhamma coincided with the conclusion of the Buddha’s sermon in Tāvatimsa. Thus the textual order of the Abhidhamma originated with Sāriputta, and the numerical series was determined by him.<br>Sāriputta is identified with various characters in numerous Jātakas. Thus he was<br>Canda-kumāra in the Devadhamma, Lakkhana in the Lakkhana, the knight in the Bhojājānīya, the monkey in the Tittira, the snake in the Visavanta and Saccankira, the tree sprite in the Sīlavanāga, the brahmin youth in the Mahāsupina, the chief disciple in the Parosahassa, the Jhānasodhana and the Candābha, the king of Benares in the Dummedha, the good ascetic in the Godha (No.138) and the Romaka, the charioteer of the king of Benares in the Rājovāda, the father-elephant in the Alīnacitta, the teacher in the Susīma, the Cūla Nandiya, the Sīlavīmamsana and the Mahādhammapāla, the merchant in the Gijjha (No.164), a goose in the Catumatta, the Nāga king in the Jarudapāna and the Sīlavimamasa, the woodpecker in the Kurungamiga, the thoroughbred in the Kundakakucchisindhava, the lion in the Vyaggha, Tittira (No. 438) and Vannāroha, the rich man in the Kurudhamma, the ascetic Jotirasa in the Abbhantara, Sumukha in the Supatta, Nandisena in the Cullakalinga, Sayha in the Sayha, the spirit of the Bodhi tree in the Pucimanda, the commander in chief in the Khantivādī, the hunter in the Mamsa, a deity in the Kakkāru, Nārada in the Kesava, the brahmin in the Kārandiya and Nandiyamiga, the Candāla in the Setaketu, the horse in the Kharapatta, Pukkasa in the Dasannaka, the sprite in the Sattubhasta and the Mahāpaduma, the roc bird in the Kotisimbali, the pupil in the Atthasadda, Sālissara in the Indriya (No. 423) and the Sarabhaṅga, Ani Mandavya in the Kanhadīpāyana, Canda in the Bilārikosiya, the senior pupil in the Mahāmaṅgala, Vāsudeva in the Ghata, Lakkhana in the Dasaratha, Uposatha in the Samvara, the northern deity in the Samuddavānija, the second goose in the Javanahamsa, the chaplain in the Sarabhamiga and the Bhikkhāparampara, the osprey in the Mahākukkusa, one of the brothers in the Bhisa, the snake in the Pañcūposatha, the Nāga king in the Mahāvānija, the king in the Rohantamiga, and the Hamsa (No. 502), Rakkhita in the Somanassa, Uggasena in the Campeyya, Assapāla in the Hatthipāla, the ascetic in the Jayadissa, Sañjaya in the Sambhava, the Nāga king in the Pandara, Alāra in the Sankhapāla, the elder son in the Cullasutosoma, Ahipāraka in the Ummadantī, Manoja in the Sonananda, the king in the Cullahamsa and the Mahāhammsa, Nārada in the Sudhābhojana, the Kunāla and the Mahājanaka, Kālahatthi in the Mahāsutasoma, the charioteer in the Mūgapakkha, Suriyakumāra in the Khandapāla, Sudassana in the Bhūridatta, Vijaya in the Mahānāradakassapa, Varuṇa in the Vidhurapaṇḍita, Cūlanī in the Mahāummagga and the ascetic Accuta in the Vessantara.2.

'sāriputta sutta':['1. Sāriputta Sutta. The sixteenth sutta of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipāta. Sāriputta asks the Buddha how a monk should conduct himself in order to achieve his goal. The Buddha explains that a monk must avoid the five dangers, endure heat and cold and other discomforts, and must not be guilty of theft, anger, lying or arrogance. He should be guided by wisdom and moderation (SN. 955 75). The Commentary explains (SNA.ii.569f ) that the sutta is also called the Therapañha Sutta, and that it was preached on the occasion of the Buddha’s descent from Tāvatimsa to Sankassa. The Buddha desired that Sāriputta’s wisdom should be adequately recognized, for Moggallāna’s iddhi, Anuruddha’s clairvoyance and Punna’s eloquence were already famous, but Sāriputta’s skill remained unknown. The Buddha therefore related the Parosahassa Jātaka in order to show Sāriputta’s wisdom in a past life. At the end of the story, Sāriputta questioned the Buddha in eight stanzas, and the rest of the sutta was spoken by the Buddha in answer to these questions.<br>2. Sāriputta Sutta. The Buddha instructs Sāriputta on how to train oneself in order to get rid of notions of ”I” and ”mine.” The sutta contains a quotation from the Udayapañha. A.i.133.<br>3. Sāriputta Sutta. Sāriputta relates to Ananda how once, when he was in Andhavana, he attained to perfect concentration. A.v.8.'],

Then follow accounts of the religions of these countries, a separate chapter being devoted to each.

'sātavāhana':['A king. It is said that, (DA.i.303; is this Sātavāhana the king of the Kathāsaritsāgara i.32?) when Anāthapindika’s family fell into poverty, owing to the alms given by him, a girl of the family, wishing to give alms, went to Sātavāhana’s kingdom, swept a threshing floor and gave alms with the money so obtained. A monk told this to the king, who sent for the girl and made her his chief queen. v.l. Setavāhana.'],
'sātāgira':['A Yakkha. He and his friend, Hemavata, were two of the twenty eight leaders of the Yakkhas. They had both been monks in the time of Kassapa Buddha, but had been guilty of deciding wrongly in the dispute which arose between Dhammavādī and Adhammavādī, hence their birth as Yakkhas, Sātāgira in Sātapabbata, and Hemavata in Himavā. They recognized each other at the Yakkha assembly in the Bhagalavatī pabbata, and promised to inform each other if, in their lives, they came across anything of interest.<br>When the Buddha was born and when he preached his first sermon, Sātāgira was present in the assembly, but, because he was constantly looking about to see if Hemavata was there, he could not concentrate his mind on the Buddha’s teaching. When the sun set and the Buddha was still preaching, he went with five hundred of his followers to fetch Hemavata. At Rājagaha they met Hemavata, who was on the way to invite Sātāgira to Himavā, which was covered with such flowers as had never before been seen. Sātāgira explains that the reason for this miracle is the appearance of the Buddha in the world, and, in answer to Hemavata’s questions, declares the greatness of the Buddha.<br>Their conversation is found in the introductory gāthā of the Hemavata Sutta (q.v.). Buddhaghosa says (SNA.i.199) that, according to some, this meeting took place, not on the occasion of the first sermon, but later, when the Buddha was living in the Gotāmaka cetiya. Kāli Kuraragharikā, as she sat by her window cooling herself, heard the conversation of the two Yakkhas, and her mind being filed with devotion to the Buddha, as she heard his wonderful qualities being enumerated she attained sotāpatti.<br>When Hemavata is satisfied, from Sātāgira’s description, that the Buddha is really the Awakened One, he decides to go to him with Sātagira. Together they go with their followers to Isipatana in the middle watch of the night, and Hemavata questions the Buddha about his teaching. Hemavata is, by nature, powerful and wise and filled with respect for the good, and the Buddha’s marvellous exposition of the dhamma fills him with great joy. He sings the Buddha’s praises in five stanzas, and, after taking leave of him and of Sātāgira, returns home with the promise that he will wander from place to place carrying the joyful news of the Buddha and his Dhamma among all beings. This story is given in the Commentary to the Hemavata Sutta; SNA.i.194 216; cf. AA.i.134f.<br>Later, when journeying through the air in various conveyances, on their way to the Yakkha assembly, Sātāgira and Hemavata and their followers were about to pass over Alavaka’s hermitage; but because the Buddha was then inside, the Yakkhas found that their conveyances remained stationary as no one could pass over the head of the Buddha. When they thus discovered his presence, they alighted and made obeisance to the Buddha, and congratulated Alavaka on his extreme good fortune in having an opportunity of meeting and listening to the Buddha. AA.i.221; a similar story is related (UdA.64) about them when they passed the abode of the Yakkha Ajakalāpaka.<br>Sātāgira is mentioned in the Atānātiya Sutta (D.iii.204) as one of the Yakkhas to be invoked in time of need by the Buddha’s followers. He is identified with the Yakkha of the Bhisa Jātaka. J.iv.314.'],
'sāti thera':['He was a fisherman’s son and held the false view that, according to the Buddha’s teaching, a man’s consciousness runs on and continues without break of identity.<br>Sāti’s colleagues did their best to change his way of thinking, but failing to do so, they reported the matter to the Buddha. He questioned Sāti, who, however, sat silent and glum; then the Buddha preached to him and the assembled monks the Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta (M.i.256 ff).<br>Buddhaghosa explains (MA.i.477) that Sāti was not a learned man. He knew only the Jātakas, and his views were due to the fact that in the Jātakas various characters were identified with the Buddha.'],
'sātimattiya thera':['He belonged to a brahmin family of Magadha and, after entering the Order, lived in the forest and developed the six fold abhiññā. Thereupon he instructed monks and preached to large numbers of lay people. One family in particular he converted to the Faith, and in that family he was waited on respectfully by a beautiful girl. Māra, wishing to disgrace him, once went to the house disguised as the Elder, and grasped the girl’s hand. But she, feeling that the touch was not human, took her hand away. The others, however, saw this and lost faith in the Thera. He, all unconscious, was aware next day of their changed manner. Discerning the work of Māra, he made them tell him what had happened. The father begged his forgiveness, and said that henceforth he himself would wait on the Elder (ThagA.i.368 f.; verses ascribed to him are found in Thag.246 8).<br>The Thera is evidently identical with Sumanatālavantiya of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.408). Ninety four kappas ago he met Siddhattha Buddha and offered him a palmyra fan (tālavanta) covered with sumana flowers.'],
'sātodīkā':['A river in Surattha (Surat). Sālissara lived in a hermitage on its banks after he left the Kavitthaka hermitage. J.iii.463; but at J.v.133 it is Mendissara who lived there.'],

'sāvatthi':['The capital town of Kosala in India and one of the six great Indian cities during the lifetime of the Buddha (D.ii.147).<br>It was six leagues from Sāketa (Vin.i.253; seven according to others, DhA.i.387), forty five leagues north west of Rājagaha (SA.i.243), thirty leagues from Sankassa (J.iv.265), one hundred and forty seven from Takkasilā (MA.ii.987), one hundred and twenty from Suppāraka (DhA.ii.213), and was on the banks of the Aciravatī (Vin.i.191, 293).<br>It was thirty leagues from Alavī (SNA.i.220), thirty from Macchīkāsanda (DhA.ii.79), one hundred and twenty from Kukkutavatī (DhA.ii.118), and the same distance from Uggapura (DhA.iii.469) and from Kuraraghara (DhA.iv.106).<br>The road from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi passed through Vesāli (Vin.ii.159f), and the Parāyanavagga (SN.vss.1011 13) gives the resting places between the two cities - Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā and Bhoganagara. Further on, there was a road running southwards from Sāvatthi through Sāketa to Kosambī. One gāvuta from the city was the Andhavana. Between Sāketa and Sāvatthi was Toranavatthu (S.iv.374).<br>The city was called Sāvatthi because the sage Savattha lived there. Another tradition says there was a caravanserai there, and people meeting there asked each other what they had ”Kim bhaṇḍam atthi?” ”Sabbam atthi” and the name of the city was based on the reply (SNA.i.300; PSA. 367).<br>The Buddha passed the greater part of his monastic life in Sāvatthi. His first visit there was at the invitation of Anāthapindika. It is said (DhA.i.4) that he spent twenty five rainy seasons in the city nineteen of them in Jetavana and six in the Pubbārāma. Sāvatthi also contained the monastery of Rājakārāma, built byPasenadi, opposite Jetavana. Outside the city gate of Sāvatthi was a fisherman’s village of five hundred families (DhA.iv.40).<br>Savatthi is the scene of each Buddha’s Yamaka pātihāriya (DhA.iii.205; cf. Mtu.iii.115; J.i.88); Gotama Buddha performed this miracle under the Gandamba.<br>The chief patrons of the Buddha in Sāvatthi were Anāthapindika, Visākhā, Suppavāsā and Pasenadi (DhA.i.330). When Bandhula left Vesāli he came to live in Sāvatthi.<br>Buddhaghosa says (Sp.iii.614) that, in the Buddha’s day, there were fifty seven thousand families in Sāvatthi, and that it was the chief city in the country of Kāsi Kosala, which was three hundred leagues in extent and had eighty thousand villages. The population of Sāvatthi was eighteen crores (SNA.i.371).<br>Sāvatthi is identified with Sāhet Māhet on the banks of the Rapti (Cunningham, AGI. 469).<br>Hiouen Thsang found the old city in ruins, but records the sites of various buildings (Beal, op. cit., ii.1 13).<br>Woodward states (KS.v.xviii ) that, of the four Nikāyas, 871 suttas are said to have been preached in Sāvatthi; 844 of which are in Jetavana, 23 in the Pubbārāma, and 4 in the suburbs. These suttas are made up of 6 in the Digha, 75 in the Majjhima, 736 in the Samyutta, and 54 in the Anguttara. Mrs. Rhys Davids conjectures (M.iv., Introd., p.vi) from this that either the Buddha ”mainly resided there or else Sāvatthi was the earliest emporium (library?) for the collection and preservation (however this was done) of the talks.” The first alternative is the more likely, as the Commentaries state that the Buddha spent twenty five rainy seasons in Sāvatthi (see earlier), this leaving only twenty to be spent elsewhere.<br>The Buddhavamsa Commentary (BuA. p.3) gives a list of these places showing that the second, third, fourth, seventeenth and twentieth were spent in Rājagaha, the thirteenth, eighteenth and nineteenth in Cāliyapabbata, and the rest in different places.'],

Having heard the word ”Buddha” from Keniya, Sela was filled with joy and fortitude, and went with his two hundred and fifty pupils to visit the Buddha in the woodland near Apana. There he observed on the person of the Buddha the thirty two marks of a Great Being all except two - viz., hidden privates and the long tongue. The Buddha read his thoughts and contrived, by his iddhi power, that Sela should be satisfied on these two points as well (This is referred to at Mil.167; DA.i.276, etc.). Sela then praised the Buddha in a series of verses and asked questions of him. At the end of his talk, Sela entered the Order with his pupils, and, at the end of a week, he attained arahantship (SN. p.104 ff. = M.ii.146f).<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Sela had been the leader of the same guild of three hundred men, and, together with them, had built a parivena for the Buddha and done many good acts.

When she was still unmarried the Buddha visited Alavī with Alavaka, whom he had converted, carrying his begging bowl and robe. On that occasion Sela went with her father to hear the Buddha preach. She became a lay disciple, but later, agitated in mind, she joined the Order and became an arahant. After that she lived inSāvatthi. One day, as she was enjoying her siesta in the Andhavana under a tree,Māra, in the guise of a stranger, approached her and tried to tempt her. But she refuted his statements regarding the attractions of lay life, and Māra had to retire discomfited (S.i.134; Thig.vss.57-9).<br>In the time of Padumuttara Buddha Selā was born in the family of a clansman of Hamsavatī and was given in marriage. After her husband’s death she devoted herself to the quest of good, and went from ārāma to ārāma and vihāra to vihāra, teaching the Dhamma to followers of the religion. One day she came to the Bodhi tree of the Buddha and sat down there thinking, ”If a Buddha be peerless among men, may this tree show the miracle of Enlightenment.” Immediately the tree blazed forth, the branches appeared golden, and the sky was all shining. Inspired by the sight, she fell down and worshipped the tree, and sat there for seven days. On the seventh day she performed a great feast of offering and worship to the Buddha (ThigA.61f). Her Apadāna verses, quoted in the Therīgāthā Commentary, are, in the Apadāna itself, attributed to a Therī called Pañcadīpikā, and are twice repeated in these verses (Ap.ii.519, repeated at 527f), however, she is mentioned as having attained arahantship at the age of seven, and there is no reference to her life as daughter of the king of Alavī.

They left the meat and the rice on the bank, but, as they bathed, a breeze blew the pot holding the food into the river. It floated down stream, where it was picked up by the elephant trainer. The Bodhisatta saw all this with his divine eye and visited the trainer at meal time. There he was offered the meat and divided it, giving the flesh to the trainer, the exterior to his wife, and keeping the bones for himself. Three days later the city was besieged by enemies. The king asked the trainer to don royal robes and mount the elephant, while he himself fought in the ranks.

'sivi jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once born as Sivi, king of Aritthapura, his father bearing the same name as himself. He ruled well, and daily gave alms to the amount of six hundred thousand. One day the desire came to him to give part of his body to any who might ask for it. Sakka read his thoughts, and, appearing before him as a blind brahmin, asked for his eyes. The king agreed to give them, and sent for his surgeon Sivaka. Amid the protests and lamentations of his family and his subjects, Sivi had his eyes removed and given to the brahmin. It is said that the surgeon did his work in several stages, giving Sivi chances of withdrawing his offer. When the sockets healed Sivi wished to become an ascetic, and went into the park with one attendant. Sakka’s throne grew hot, and appearing before Sivi, he offered him a boon. The king wished to die, but Sakka insisted on his choosing something else. He then asked that his sight might be restored. Sakka suggested an Act of Truth (sacca-kiriyā), as not even Sakka could restore lost sight. The eyes reappeared, but they were neither natural eyes nor divine, but eyes called ”Truth, Absolute and Perfect.” Sivi collected all his subjects, and, resting on a throne in a pavilion, taught them the value of gifts.<br>The story was related in reference to Pasenadi’s Asadisadāna. On the seventh day of the almsgiving the king gave all kinds of requisites and asked the Buddha to preach a thanksgiving sermon, but the Buddha left without doing so. The next day, on being questioned by the king, he explained his reasons for this (For details see Asadisadāna). The king, greatly pleased with the Buddha’s explanation, gave him an outer robe of Siveyyaka cloth worth one thousand. When the monks started commenting on how tireless the king was in giving, the Buddha related to them the old story, in which Ananda is identified with Sivaka, the physician, and Anuruddha with Sakka (J.iv.401-12; of. CypA.52f).<br>The Sivirājacariyā is included in the Cariyāpitaka (Cyp.i.8; the story is also given with variant details in the Avadānasataka i.183-6). It forms the topic of one of the dilemmas of the Milinda-Pañha. Mil.p.119f.'],
'siviputta':['See Sivirattha.'],
'sivirattha':['The country of the Sivi people, referred to several times in the Jātakas. In the Sivi, Ummadantī and Mahāummagga Jātakas (J.iv.401; v.210; vi.419), Aritthapura is given as the capital, while in the Vessantara Jātaka (J.vi.480), Jetuttara is the capital.<br>In the last named Jātaka (E.g., p.511), Vessantara is sometimes spoken of as king of Sivirattha and his children as Siviputtā (p.563). The family name of the kings of this country seems to have been Sivi (See J.vi.251, where Sivi is explained by porānakarājā).<br>The country was evidently famous for its cloth, which was called Siveyyaka (Vin.i.278).

'sīha':['1. Sīha. A Licchavi general of Vesāli. He was a follower of the Niganthas. When the Buddha visited Vesāli, Sīha, having heard reports of his greatness, wished to see him, but Nigantha Nātaputta dissuaded him, saying that Gotama denied the result of actions and was not worth a visit. But in the end Sīha, accompanied by five hundred chariots, went to the Buddha. Having discovered in conversation with the Buddha that he was falsely accused of preaching wrong doctrines, Sīha declared himself the Buddha’s follower. The Buddha accepted his adherence on condition that he would continue to give alms to any Niganthas who sought them at his house. This generosity made Sīha honour the Buddha even more highly, and he invited him and the monks to a meal on the next day. Meat formed one of the dishes, and the Niganthas went about Vesāli crying that Sīha had killed a large ox to provide meat for the Buddha and his monks and that the food had been accepted. This was the occasion for the formulation of the rule that no monk should eat flesh where he has reason to believe that the animal had been specially killed for him (Vin.i.233f.; A.iv.179f.; see also the Telovāda Jātaka).<br>Sīha was, at one time, one of the most famous patrons of the Niganthas, the others being Upāligahapati of Nālandā, and Vappa, the Sākiyan of Kapilavatthu (AA.ii.751).<br>The Anguttara Nikāya (A.iii.38f; iv.79f ) contains two discussions, in more or less identical terms, in which Sīha asks the Buddha if it is possible to show the visible results of giving. The Buddha, by means of a counter question, elicits from Sīha that the giver has his reward in this world itself, and in the end Sīha acknowledges that he has experienced the benefits which the Buddha set forth.<br>Sīha had a niece, Sīhā.<br>2. Sīha Thera. He was born in the family of a rājā in the Malla country and visited the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a sermon suitable to his temperament, and he entered the Order. He lived in the forest in meditation, but his thoughts were distracted. The Buddha, seeing this, went through the air and spoke to him alone, asking him to persevere. Thus incited, he strove hard and attained arahantship.<br>He was once a kinnara on the banks of the Candabhāgā, and seeing Atthadassī Buddha journeying through the air, he stood still, gazing at him with clasped hands. The Buddha alighted and sat under a tree, where the kinnara offered him flowers and sandalwood. Sīha was three times king, under the name of Rohinī (ThagA.i.179). He is probably identical with Candanapūjaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.165.<br>3. Sīha. A novice who entered the Order at the age of seven and was a great favourite among the monks for his charm. He was much liked by the Buddha. He was a student under Nāgita, and was with him when the Buddha once stayed in Vesāli. Seeing a great number of people coming to visit the Buddha, he informed Nāgita of this, and, with his permission, went to tell the Buddha. This led to the preaching of the Mahāli Sutta (D.i.151).<br>Buddhaghosa adds (DA.i.310) that Nāgita was fat and lazy and that most of his work was done by Sīha, who was his sister’s son.<br>4. Sīha.

'sona':['Once when Manoja was king of Brahmavaddhana (Benares), the Bodhisatta was born as Sona, the son of a rich brahmin. He had a brother Nanda. When the boys grew up their parents wanted them to marry, but they refused, and declared their desire to become ascetics after the death of their parents. Then the parents suggested that they should all, at once, become ascetics; this they did, and lived in a pleasant grove in the Himālaya. After some time, because Nanda brought unripe fruit for his parents in spite of Sona’s warning, Sona dismissed him. Nanda thereupon sought Manoja, and, with his magic power, helped him to win various kingdoms in Jambudīpa, bringing into subjection one hundred and one kings in seven years, seven months and seven days. All these kings Manoja brought to Brahmavaddhana, where he caroused with them. Nanda spent his time in the Suvannaguhā in the Himālaya, obtaining his alms from Uttarakuru. At the end of the seventh day Manoja looked for Nanda, who, reading his thoughts, appeared before him. Manoja wished to give some token of his gratitude, and Nanda asked that he should intercede for him with Sona and win for him Sona’s forgiveness. Together they went to Sona accompanied by a large retinue. Sona explained why he had forbidden Nanda, to look after their parents, and Nanda asked his forgiveness for having given his parents unripe fruit in his eagerness to wait on them. Sona forgave him, and they all lived together once more, while the kings returned to their countries, where they ruled wisely.<br>The occasion for the story is the same as that for the Sāma Jātaka (q.v.), regarding a monk who supported his mother. Nanda is identified with Ananda and Manoja with Sāriputta (J.v.312, p.332).<br>The story is also given in the Cariyapitaka. Cyp.iii.v.'],
'soṇadaṇḍa':['A rich brahmin of Campā, very learned in the Vedas; he lived in a royal domain, given to him as royal fief by KingBimbisāra. When the Buddha was in Campā, on the banks of the Gaggarā-lake, Sonadanda visited him in spite of the protests of his friends and colleagues. Their conversation is recorded in the Sonadanda Sutta. At the end of the discourse, Sonadanda expressed his appreciation of the Buddha and his doctrine, and invited him and his monks to a meal. At the conclusion of the meal Sonadanda asked the Buddha to forgive him if, in the presence of the brahmins, he did not make humble obeisance to the Buddha, but merely saluted him.<br>Buddhaghosa explains (D.i.111ff., DA.i.292ff) that this was because Sonadanda was much older than the Buddha and did not wish people to see him paying homage to one young enough to be his grandson.

When her husband renounced the world, she distributed her wealth among her children, keeping nothing for herself.<br>Her children soon ceased to show her any respect, and she entered the Order in her old age. She waited on the nuns and studied most of the night. Soon her streṇuous energy became known to the Buddha, and he, sending forth a ray of glory, spoke to her. Then she attained arahantship. Her resolve to win eminence was made in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, when she was the daughter of a rich setthi.

When the nuns came to look for water she told them that if they wanted warm water they could have it from the vessel. They found the water hot, and understood. Then they begged her forgiveness.<br>6.

'soṇuttara':['1. Sonuttara Thera. An arahant. He lived in thePūjā-parivena in theMahāvihāra and was entrusted byDutthagāmaṇī with the task of finding relics for the Mahā Thūpa. In the time of the Buddha he had been the brahmin Nanduttara, and had entertained the Buddha on the occasion on which, at Payāgatittha,Bhaddaji Thera had raised, from the bed of the Ganges, the palace he had occupied as Mahāpanāda. Filled with marvel, Nanduttara wished that he might have the power of procuring relics possessed by others. Sonuttara visited theMañjerika-nāga-bhavana and asked the Nāga king, Mahākāla, to give him the relics which he had there and which had once been enshrined in Rāmagāma. But Mahākāla, unwilling to part with them, told his nephew,Vāsuladatta, to hide them. Sonuttara knew this, and when Mahākāla told him he might take the relics if he could find them, Sonuttara, by his magic power, took the relic casket from Vāsuladatta, unknown to him, and brought it to Anurādhapura, where the relics were deposited in the Mahā Thūpa.

'sopāka':['1. Sopāka Thera. He was the son of a very poor woman of Sāvatthi. While in labour his mother fell into a long and deep swoon, and her kinsfolk, thinking her dead, took her to the cemetery and prepared for cremation. But a spirit prevented the fire from burning with a storm of wind and rain, and they went away. The child was safely born and the mother died. The spirit, in human shape, took the child and put it in the watchman’s hut, feeding it for a time. After that the watchman adopted it, and the child grew up with the watchman’s son, Suppiya (q.v.). He was called Sopāka, (the ”waif”) because he was born in the cemetery. When he was seven years old he came under the notice of the Buddha, who visited him in the cemetery. Gladdened by the Buddha’s teaching, he sought his father’s consent and entered the Order. The Buddha gave him, as his subject of meditation, the thought of mettā, and Sopika, developing insight, soon attained arahantship.<br>In the time of Kakusandha Buddha, he was a householder’s son and gave the Buddha some bījapūra-fruits. He also provided three monks with milk rice daily to the end of his life. In another birth he gave a meal of milk rice to a Pacceka Buddha (Thag.vs.33; ThagA.i.94f).<br>He is perhaps identical with Vibhītakamiñjaya of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.396.<br>2. Sopāka Thera. He was born as the child of a cemetery keeper and was therefore called Sopāka. Others say that he was born in a trader’s family and that Sopāka was merely a name. Four months after birth his father died suddenly and he was adopted by his uncle. When he was only seven years old, his uncle took him to a charnel field because he quarrelled with his cousin, bound his hands, and tied him fast to a corpse, hoping that the jackals would eat him. At midnight the jackals came and the child started crying. The Buddha, seeing Sopāka’s destiny for arahantship, sent a ray of glory, and, by the Buddha’s power, the boy broke his bonds and stood before the Buddha’s Gandhakuti, a sotāpanna. His mother started seeking for him, and the uncle telling her nothing, she came to the Buddha, thinking ”The Buddhas know all, past, present and future.” When she came, the Buddha, by his iddhi-power, made the boy invisible and taught her the Dhamma, saying that sons are no shelter, blood bonds no refuge. As she listened she became a sotāpanna and the boy an arahant. Then the Buddha revealed the boy’s presence to his mother, and she allowed him to enter the Order. Some time later the Buddha, wishing to confer on him the higher ordination, asked him the questions which came to be known as the ”Kumārapañhā” Sopāka answered these, and the Buddha, satisfied, gave him the upasampadā.<br>Sopāka had been a brahmin in the time of Siddhattha Buddha, expert in the Vedas. He later became an ascetic and lived on a mountain. The Buddha, foreseeing his imminent death, visited him. The brahmin spread for him a seat of flowers. The Buddha preached to him on impermanence and left through the air. Thag.vss.480-6; ThagA.i.477f.; Ap.i.64f.; KhpA.76; see also DhA.iv.176f.'],
'soreyya':['1. Soreyya. A town where Soreyya-Revata lived (Vin.ii.299). In the time of the Buddha there was a caravan route between Soreyya and Takkasilā (DhA.i.326). There was also a direct route from Verañjā to Payāgatittha, passing through Soreyya, Sankassa and Kannakuja (Vin.iii.11; see also Soreyya-Revata).<br>At one time Mahā Kaccāyana lived near Soreyya (DhA.i.325). It was evidently a very ancient city, for Anomadassī Buddha is mentioned as having twice preached there once to King Isidatta and again to the king of Soreyya; and it was there that he held his first assembly of monks (BuA.143, 144). Vessabhū Buddha also preached there later to a very large assembly (BuA.206).<br>2. Soreyya. A setthiputta of Soreyya. Once, when he and a friend with a large retinue were driving out of the city to bathe, he saw Mahā Kaccāyana adjusting his robe before entering the city for alms. Soreyya saw the Elder’s body, and wished that he could make him his wife or that his wife’s body might become in colour like the Elder’s. Immediately Soreyya turned into a woman, and, hiding from his companions, went with a caravan bound for Takkasilā. Arrived at Takkasilā, he became the wife of the Treasurer of that city and had two sons. He had already two sons in Soreyya, born to him before his transformation.<br>Some time after, he saw his former friend driving in a carriage through Takkasilā, and, sending a slave woman to him, invited him to the house and entertained him. The friend was unable to recognize him till he revealed the truth. Thereupon they both returned to Soreyya and invited Mahā Kaccāyana to a meal. Soreyya fell at his feet, confessed his fault, and asked for forgiveness. When the Elder pardoned him, he once more became a man. He entered the Order under the Elder and went with him to Sāvatthi. There people having heard his story worried him with questions. He therefore retired into solitude, and, developing insight, became an arahant. Before that, when people asked him which of his children he loved best, he would say: ”Those to whom I gave birth while a woman”; but after attaining arahantship he would say: ”My affections are set on no one.” DhA.i.324ff.'],

The interview is described in the Subha Sutta. At the end of the discourse he declared himself the Buddha’s follower. While on his way back from the city, he met Jānussoni, and, on being asked what he thought of the Buddha, spoke of him in terms of the highest praise, saying that none but Gotama’s own peer could utter sufficient praise of him (M.i.196f., 208f.; Jānussoni addresses him as Bhāradvāja). Subha is described (MA.ii.802; cf. M.i.202) as the son of the brahminTodeyya of Tudigāma.<br>Elsewhere however, a different account is given of his conversion. (DA.ii.384f.; cf. MA.ii.963f., which adds that the Buddha proved the identity of the dog by getting it to indicate the place where Todeyya’s treasure lay buried). Subba’s father was a very rich merchant, chaplain toPasenadi, but a great miser. After death he was born as a dog in the same home. One day, when the Buddha was going his alms round in Tudigāma near Sāvatthi, he arrived at Subha’s house. The dog saw the Buddha and barked, and the Buddha addressed it as ”Todeyya.” The dog thereupon ran into the house and lay on a bed, from which no one could drive it away. When Subha asked the cause of the uproar, he was told the story. Thereupon he was very angry, saying that his father had been born in the Brahmaloka, and, in order to refute the Buddha, he visited the monastery. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Subha Sutta. Soon after the Buddha’s death, when Ananda, was staying in Sāvatthi, Subha sent a young man to Ananda, with his respects and an invitation to his house. Ananda, having taken medicine, did not go that day. But he went the next day, accompanied by a monk of Cetiya (Cetaka). Their conversation is recorded in the Subha Sutta (2) (D.i.204f).

One day, while Subha was on the throne, he reprimanded the king, disguised as a guard, for smiling disrespectfully, and had him led away and executed before the truth was discovered. Subha then became king and ruled for six years (120-6 A.C.).<br>He built the Subharāja-parivena, the Vallī-vihāra, the Ekadvāra vihāra and the Nandīgāmaka-vihāra.

'subha sutta':['1. Subha Sutta. Subha Todeyyaputta visits the Buddha at Sāvatthi and asks him various questions regarding the Dhamma, comparing it with the teachings of the brahmins regarding ultimate salvation. He admits that no one among the brahmins or the early sages had fully discerned and realized the qualities laid down by them for the attainment of merit and the achievement of right. He quotes Pokkharasāti as saying that those who, like Gotama, profess to transcend ordinary human beings and rise to the heights of Ariyan knowledge are idle boasters. The Buddha retorts that Pokkharasāti cannot even read the thoughts of his slave girl, Punnikā. The Buddha then convinces Subha that he has discovered the way to union with Brahmā, and, at his request, teaches him this way, as being the four Brahma-vihāras. Subha acknowledges himself the Buddha’s follower. (M.99).<br>2. Subha Sutta. A conversation between Subha Todeyyaputta andAnanda at Sāvatthi soon after the Buddha’s death.

She was the daughter of a rich goldsmith of Rājagaha. One day she went to pay obeisance to the Buddha and he preached to her. She became a sotāpanna, and later she joined the Order under Mahā Pajāpatī. From time to time her relations tried to persuade her to leave the Order and return to the world. One day she set forth, in twenty four verses, the dangers of household life and dismissed them, convinced of her rightness. Then, striving for insight, she attained arahantship on the eighth day (Thig.vs.338-61). The Buddha saw this and praised her in three verses (Thig.vs.362-4). Sakka visited her with the gods of Tāvatimsa and uttered another verse in her praise. ThigA.365; ThigA.236f.<br>3. Subhā Jīvakambavanikā. She belonged to an eminent brahmin family of Rājagaha, and, seeing the bane in the pleasures of sense, became a nun under Pajāpatī Gotamī. She was called Subhā because her body was beautiful. One day, in Jīvakambavana, a libertine, in the prime of youth, seeing her going to her siesta, stopped her, inviting her to sensual pleasures. She talked to him of the evils of such pleasures, but he persisted. Seeing that he was particularly enamoured of the beauty of her eyes, she pulled out one of them, saying: ”Come, here is the offending eye.” The man was appalled and asked her forgiveness. Subhā went to the Buddha, and, at sight of him, her eye recovered.<br>Filled with joy, she stood worshipping him, and he taught her and gave her an exercise for meditation.

He was a follower of the Buddha, and, after visiting him together with Suddhavāsa, he went on to another Brahmā, who was infatuated with his own importance.

The viceroy therefore left the city with his wife and lived in a hut in a frontier village. When he discovered, by observing the stars, that the king was dead, he returned with his wife to take the throne. On the way they passed a mountain, and his wife asked: ”If this mountain were of pure gold, would you give me some of it?” ”Not an atom,” he replied, and she was deeply hurt. She became queen, but was shown no respect or honour by the king. The Bodhisatta, noticing this, questioned her and made her promise to repeat her story in the king’s presence. This she did, and the king, realizing her affection for him, bestowed all honour on her.<br>The story was told to a landowner of Sāvatthi who went with his wife to collect a debt. They received a cart in satisfaction of the debt, and, leaving it with friends, were on the way home when they saw a mountain, and a conversation, identical with the one above, took place. Arrived at Sāvatthi, they went to Jetavana, and when the Buddha asked the wife if she were happy, she told him what had happened.

Once, when the Buddha was at the Tankitamañca in Gayā, which was the abode of Suciloma, Suciloma and his friend, Khara, happened to be passing by, and Suciloma, coming up to the Buddha, bent his body against the Buddha’s. The Buddha bent his body in the opposite direction, saying that contact with him was an evil thing. Then Suciloma asked him a question regarding the origin of various persuasions, and the Buddha answered him (Ap.ii.434; the same verses occur).<br>It is said that Suciloma was a lay follower of Kassapa Buddha and used to visit the vihāra eight times a month to hear the Dhamma.

One day, when he heard the gong announcing the preaching, he was working in a field near the vihāra, and thinking he would be late if he stayed to wash, he entered the uposatha hall, where he lay on a very costly rug. As a result of this action, the hairs of his body resembled needles hence his name.

When a Buddha is about to be born, the inhabitants of the Suddhāvāsā insert a knowledge of the signs of a Great Being in the Vedas and teach this among men in the guise of brahmins, calling such knowledge buddhamanta. Men learn it and are thus able to recognize a Great Being (MA.ii.761; SNA.ii.448). The inhabitants of the Suddhāvāsā know how many Buddhas will be born in any particular kappa by observing the number of lotuses which spring up on the site of the Bodhi-pallanka when the earth gradually emerges after the destruction of the world (DA.ii.411).

'suddhodana':['A Sākiyan Rājā of Kapilavatthu and father of Gotama Buddha.<br>He was the son of Sihahanu and Kaccānā. His brothers were Dhotodana, Sakkodana, Sukkodana and Amitodana, and his sisters were Amitā and Pamitā.<br>Māyā was his chief consort, and, after her death her sister Pajāpatī was raised to her position (Mhv.ii.15f.; Dpv.iii.45; J.i.15, etc.).<br>When soothsayers predicted that his son Gotama had two destinies awaiting him, either that of universal sovereignty or of Buddha hood, he exerted his utmost power to provide the prince with all kinds of luxuries in order to hold him fast to household life. It is said (E.g., J.i.54) that when Asita, who was his father’s chaplain and his own teacher, visited Suddhodana to see the newly born prince, and paid homage to the infant by allowing his feet to rest on his head, Suddhodana was filled with wonder and himself worshipped the child. And when, at the ploughing ceremony, Suddhodana saw how the jambu-tree under which the child had been placed kept its shadow immoveable in order to protect him, and that the child was seated cross legged in the air, he again worshipped him (J.i.57f).<br>Later, when, in spite of all his father’s efforts, the prince had left household life and was practising austerities, news was brought to Suddhodana that his son had died owing to the severity of his penances. But he refused to believe it, saying that his son would never die without achieving his goal (J.i.67). When this was afterwards related to the Buddha, he preached the Mahādhammapāla Jātaka and showed that in the past, too, Suddhodana had refused to believe that his son could have died even when he was shown the heap of his bones.<br>When news reached Suddhodana that his son had reached Enlightenment, he sent a messenger to Veluvana in Rājagaha with ten thousand others to invite the Buddha to visit Kapilavatthu. But the messenger and his companions heard the Buddha preach, entered the Order, and forgot their mission. Nine times this happened. On the tenth occasion, Suddhodana sent Kāludāyī with permission for him to enter the Order on the express condition that he gave the king’s invitation to the Buddha. Kāludāyī kept his promise and the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu, staying in theNigrodhārāma. There, in reference to a shower of rain that fell, he preached the Vessantara Jātaka. The next day, when Suddhodana remonstrated with the Buddha because he was seen begging in the streets of Kapilavatthu, the Buddha told him that begging was the custom of all Buddhas, and Suddhodana hearing this became asotāpanna. He invited the Buddha to his palace, where he entertained him, and at the end of the meal the Buddha preached to the king, who became a sakadāgāmī (J.i.90; cf. DhA.iii.164f). He became an anāgāmī after hearing theMahādhammapāla Jātaka(DhA.i.99; J.iv.55), and when he was about to die, the Buddha came from Vesāli to see him and preach to him, and Suddhodana became an arahant and died as a lay arahant (ThigA.141).<br>Nanda was Suddhodana’s son byMahā Pajāpati, and he had also a daughter called Sundarī Nandā. When the Buddha ordained bothRāhula and Nanda, Suddhodana was greatly distressed lest other parents should be similarly afflicted, and persuaded the Buddha to establish a rule that none should be ordained without the permission of his parents (Vin.i.82f).<br>Suddhodana was the Bodhisatta’s father in numerous births, but he is specially mentioned as such by name in only a few Jātakas e.g.,<br>Katthahāri, Alīnacitta, Susīma, Bandhanāgāra, Kosambī, Mahādhammapāla, Dasaratha, Hatthipāla, Mahāummagga Vessantara.'],

One day Sāriputta, at the head of several eminent monks, visited Macchikāsanda and stayed in the monastery. Citta heard Sāriputta preach (and became a sakadāgāmin, says DhA), and, at the end of the sermon, invited him and the monks to his house the next day. He also invited Sudhamma, but because he had been invited after the others, Sudhamma refused to go. Early the next day he visited Citta’s house to see what offerings had been prepared, and after seeing them, remarked that one thing was missing: sesame cakes (tilasangulikā). Then Citta rebuked him, comparing him to a crow, the offspring of a cock and a crow. Sudhamma left the house in anger, and going to Sāvatthi, reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha blamed Sudhamma and said that the Sangha should pass the patisārānīyakamma on him. Sudhamma, thereupon, went to Macchikāsanda to ask pardon of Citta, but Citta would not forgive him. The Buddha then gave him a companion, and together they went to Citta, and Sudhamma again asked pardon for his fault. Citta pardoned him and asked to be pardoned himself (Vin.i.15-20; cf.

A search was started for a seasoned pinnacle. Sudhammā agreed to give hers if she were allowed a share in the building.

There the Devas hold their meetings on the eighth day of each month, or when the Dhamma is preached, and also all their important festivals and gatherings (See, e.g., D.ii.268; M.ii.79; S.i.221; J.vi.97, 126; Thag.vs.1198).

'sudhābhojana jātaka':['There once lived in Benares a wealthy householder, worth eighty crores. He offered his wealth to the king, who, however, had no need for it; so he gave much away in gifts and was born as Sakka. Equally generous were his descendants - Canda, Suriya, Mātali and Pañcasikha. But the next in descent, Pañcasikha’s son, Maccharikosiya, became a miser. He stopped all giving and lived in abject poverty. One day, seeing his sub-treasurer eating rice porridge, he wished for some himself, but, owing to his miserliness, he went in disguise to the river with a little rice and there started to cook it with the help of a slave. Sakka saw this, and, accompanied by Canda and the others, appeared before him disguised as a brahmin. Advancing towards him, Sakka asked him the way to Benares, and, pretending to be deaf, approached the place where the porridge was being cooked and asked for some. Maccharikosiya refused to give him any, but Sakka insisted on reciting to him some stanzas on the value of giving, and then Kosiya agreed to give him a little porridge. One by one the others, also disguised as brahmins, approached, and, in spite of all his efforts, Kosiya was forced to invite them to share his meal. He asked them to fetch small leaves, but in their hands small leaves became large. After the porridge had been served, Pañcasikha assumed the form of a dog, then of a horse of changing colours, and started chasing Kosiya, while the others stood motionless in the air. Kosiya asked how beings could gain such powers, and Sakka explained to him and revealed their identity. Maccharikosiya went back to Benares and gave away his wealth in charity. Later he became a hermit and lived in a hut.<br>At that time the four daughters of Sakka - Asā, Saddhā, Sirī and Hirī - went to Anotatta to play in the water. There they saw Nārada under a pāricchattaka-flower, which served him as a sunshade, and each asked him for the flower. Nārada said he would give it to the best of them, and referred them to Sakka. Sakka sent (by Mātali) a cup of ambrosia (sudhābhojana) to Kosiya, and said that whichever of his daughters succeeded in persuading Kosiya to share with her his drink would be adjudged the best. He listened to all their claims and decided in favour of Hirī. Sakka, wishing to know why he decided thus, sent Mātali in his chariot to ask him. While Mātali was yet speaking to him, Kosiya died and was reborn in Tāvatimsa. Sakka gave him Hirī as wife and also a share of the kingdom of Tāvatimsa.<br>The story was told in reference to a monk of Sāvatthi, who was so generous that he would give away his own food and drink and so starve. He is identified with Maccharikosiya, Uppalavannā with Hirī, Anuruddha with Pañcasikha, Ananda with Mātali, Kassapa with Suriya, Moggallāna with Canda, Sāriputta with Nārada, and Sakka with the Buddha himself.

When there was a famine in the Vajji country, Sudinna went to Vesāli, hoping to be kept by his rich relations, to the mutual benefit of both parties. They gave him sixty bowls of rice, which he distributed among his colleagues. When he went to his father’s house, in Kalandakagāma, he saw a servant girl about to throw away some boiled rice and asked her to put it into his bowl. The girl, recognizing his hands and feet and voice, told his mother of his arrival. Both she and his father visited him as he was eating the rice, and his father took him by the hand and led him home. There he was provided with a seat and asked to eat: but he refused, saying he had already eaten. The next day he was again invited; he went, and they tried to tempt him back to the lay life. His former wife joined in the attempt, but on being addressed by him as ”Sister,” she fell fainting. Then he begged for his meal, saying that if they desired to give it to him they should do so without worrying him. Later his wife visited him, with his mother, at the Mahāvana, and begged that he would give her a son, so that the Licchavis might not confiscate their wealth for want of an heir. Sudinna agreed, and had intercourse three times with her. She became pregnant, and in due course a son was born, who was called Bījaka. When Sudinna realized what he had done he was filled with remorse, and his colleagues, discovering the reason, reported him to the Buddha, who blamed him greatly. (Vin.iii.11-21; see Sp.i.270, where Sudinna is held not guilty of the Pārājikā offence because he was an ādikammika.).<br>The Buddha’s censure of Sudinna forms the topic of one of the dilemmas of the Milinda-Pañha.

The dealers complained to the minister. After inquiring into the matter, he advised them to bring Suhanu, a very strong horse they had, the next time they visited Benares. This they did, and when Mahāsona and Suhanu were confronted with each other they showed great affection, and started licking each other. The king saw this, and was told by his minister that the horses recognized each other’s virtues. He then warned the king against excessive covetousness.<br>The story was told in reference to two hot headed monks, both passionate and cruel. One lived in Jetavana and the other in the country.

This she did, eating only such fish as had died a natural death. One day, Sakka, wishing to test her, assumed the form of a fish and pretended to be dead. Just as Sujā was about to swallow the fish, it wriggled its tail and she let it go. A few days later she died, and was born as the daughter of a potter of Benares.

Stop it!” On another day they heard a cuckoo singing and stood listening eagerly. The Bodhisatta pointed this out to his mother and left her to draw her own inference.

The king was very angry; but the Bodhisatta interceded on her behalf and she was pardoned.<br>The story was told in reference to a quarrel between Mallikā and Pasenadi, which became famous under the name of Sirivivāda or Sayanakalaha. Pasenadi ignored Mallikā completely, and the Buddha, knowing this, went to the palace with five hundred monks.

This was on the very day of the Buddha’s Enlightenment, and Punnā, finding Gotama sitting under the banyan, thought that he was the tree god present in person to receive the offering.

If you cannot obtain it through your own merit, you can obtain it through mine.” So saying, he returned to his cell and meditated on the nature of the body. Sakka’s throne was heated, and he sent the Four Regent Gods to keep away all noise from Sukha’s cell. He also bade the Sun and Moon stand still. Sukha, helped by this silence, became an anāgāmī.<br>Meanwhile, Sāriputta had gone to a house where he knew he could get the food desired by Sukha, and, having eaten there, returned with Sukha’s portion to the monastery. The Buddha, thinking that Sāriputta’s arrival might impede Sukha’s attainment of arahantship, appeared near the gate of Sukha’s cell and stood guard. As he stood there, the Buddha asked Sāriputta four questions. When the last question was answered, Sukha became an arahant. Thereupon Sāriputta opened the door and gave Sukha his food.

'sumanā':['Sumanā, sister of Pasenadi, visits the Buddha atJetavana with five hundred companions in five hundred chariots and asks him whether, in the case of two disciples, alike in faith, virtue and insight, the one being an almsgiver and the other not, there be any distinction. The Buddha replies that whether they be born in the deva world or in the world of men, the giver would be superior in life span, beauty, happiness, honour and power. There would still be a difference between them, even when, in later life, they both enter the Order, but the difference would cease to exist on their becoming arahants (A.iii.32f).<br>The Commentary adds (AA.ii.595f ) that Sumanā’s questions were the result of a conversation between two babies born in the house of the King of Kosala, one as the king’s son, the other as the son of one of the attendant women. The children were laid side by side on two beds, the prince’s bed being higher and better. They had both been monks in their previous life; the prince was a sārānīyadhammapūraka, the other a bhattaggapūraka. The prince saw his past life, and, realizing that the other had not taken his advice and had, therefore, suffered eclipse, addressed him as he lay on the next bed. Sumanā heard their talk, but spoke no word of it to anyone, in case the children should be thought to be possessed of evil spirits.'],

He saw a man sleeping, and thought to himself that the man must be a thief. The man conceived a grudge against Sumaṅgala, and burned his fields seven times, cut the feet off the cattle in his pen seven times, and burned his house seven times. Then knowing that Sumaṅgala loved the Buddha’s Gandhakuti, he also set fire to that. It was burnt down by the time Sumaṅgala could arrive there; seeing it, he clasped his hands, saying that now he could build another in its place. Then the thief went about with a knife concealed on him, waiting to kill Sumaṅgala. One day Sumaṅgala held a great almsgiving, at the conclusion of which he said: ”Sir, there is evidently an enemy of mine trying to do me harm.

A Thera to whom he confessed his desire ordained him, and sent him to the forest with an exercise for meditation. In solitude he pined and wavered, and finally returned to his village. As he went along he saw men working in the fields in the hot wind, with soiled garments, covered with dust.

'sumaṅgala jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares and had a park keeper called Sumaṅgala (10).<br>A Pacceka Buddha came from Nandamūlapabbhāra and took up his abode in the park. The king, seeing him as he went begging, invited him to the palace, fed him, and urged him to continue to stay in the park. The Pacceka Buddha agreed to do so, and the king told Sumaṅgala to look after him. One day the Pacceka Buddha went away to a village, and, after an absence of some days, returned in the evening. Putting away his bowl and robe, he sat on a stone seat. Sumaṅgala, looking in the park for some meat in order to feed some relations who had suddenly arrived, saw the Pacceka Buddha, and, taking him for a deer, shot him. The Pacceka Buddha revealed his identity and made Sumaṅgala pull out the arrow. Sumaṅgala was full of remorse, but the Pacceka Buddha died. Feeling sure that the king would never forgive him, Sumaṅgala fled with his wife and children. After a year he asked a friend, a minister at court, to discover how the king felt towards him. The man uttered his praises in the king’s presence, but the king remained silent. This was repeated every year, and in the third year, knowing that the king now bore him no ill will, he returned to the king, who, after hearing from him how the accident had happened, forgave him. When asked why he had remained silent, the king replied that it was wrong for a king to act hastily in his anger.<br>Sumaṅgala is identified with Ananda.

The Buddha explained that what the man had seen was real; it was an Asura army, fleeing from the devas in panic, through a lotus stalk (S.v.447f.; cf.

Near the city was the Bhesakalāvana where the Buddha stayed.<br>During his visits there he preached the Anumāna Sutta (M.i.95f ) and the Bodhirāja Sutta (M.ii.91f). The city was the residence ofNakulapītā and his wife, with whom the Buddha had several interviews. (E.g., A.ii.61; iii.295 f; iv.268; S.iii.1; iv.116).<br>It is said that once, when the Buddha was at Sumsumāragiri, he saw with his divine eye Moggallāna atKallavālamutta half asleep, and appeared before him and admonished him (A.iv.85).<br>On another occasion, he saw Anuruddha in the Veluvana in the Ceti country, pondering over the seven Mahāpurisavitakkas, and appeared before him to encourage him (A.iv.228f). Both incidents show that the Buddha visited Sumsumāragiri quite early in his career, in the first year after the Enlightenment. Moggallāna also stayed in Sumsumāragiri, and there Māra is said to have entered his stomach and to have given him trouble (M.i.332f.; cf.

'sunakkhatta':['A Licchavi prince of Vesāli. He was, at one time, a member of the Order and the personal attendant of theBuddha (anibaddhaupatthāka), but was later converted to the views of Korakkhattiya and went about defaming the Buddha, saying that he had nothing superhuman and was not distinguished from other men by preaching a saving faith: that the doctrine preached by him did not lead to the destruction of sorrow, etc.Sāriputta, on his alms rounds in Vesāli, heard all this and reported it to the Buddha, who thereupon preached theMahāsīhanāda Sutta (M.i.68ff.; the Buddha was, at this time, eighty years old, M.i.82) and theLomahamsa Jātaka (J.i.389f.; see also J.iv.95). The Sunakkhatta Sutta (M.ii.252ff) was evidently preached to Sunakkhatta before he joined the Order, while thePātika Sutta (D.iii.1ff) gives an account of his dissatisfaction.<br>His grievance was that the Buddha showed no mystic superhuman wonders, that he had not shown him the beginning of things. The Buddha reminded him that he had not promised to do any of these things, and that, at one time, Sunakkhatta had been loud in his praise of the Buddha and the Dhamma. The Buddha warned him that people would say he had left the Order because its discipline had proved too hard for him. The Buddha had told him that Korakkhattiya, whom he so much admired, would be born after death among theKālakañjaka Asuras within seven days. It happened as the Buddha prophesied, and the dead body of Kora declared that he was right. But even so, Sunakkhatta was not convinced.<br>Later he transferred his allegiance to Kandaramasaka, who died, as the Buddha had prophesied, fallen from grace and fame. The next teacher to win the admiration of Sunakkhatta wasPātikaputta, and Sunakkhatta wished the Buddha to pay honour to him. But the Buddha quoted to Sunakkhatta the words ofAjita, the Licchavi general who had been born inTāvatimsa, to the effect that Pātikaputta was ”a liar and a cheat,” and was later able to prove that these words were true. But Sunakkhatta did not return to the Order. He had probably remained in it for several years before actually leaving it. For we find in theMahāli Sutta (D.i.152) the LicchaviOtthaddha relating to the Buddha how Sunakkhatta had come to him three years after joining the Order, claiming that he could see divine forms but could not hear heavenly sounds.Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.311) that he could not acquire the power of hearing divine sounds because in a previous birth he had ruptured the ear drum of a holy monk and made him deaf. The Sutta itself gives (D.i.153) as the reason that he had only developed one sided concentration of mind.<br>Sunakkhatta is identified with Kānāritha of theBhūridatta Jātaka. J.vi.219.'],
'sunakkhatta sutta':['Preached at Vesāli to Sunakkhatta, before he joined the Order.<br>He asks the Buddha if the monks have really won all they profess or if some of them are extravagant in their professions.

Craving is the arrow; the wound represents the six sense organs within; ignorance is the poison; mindfulness is the surgeon’s probing; Noble Understanding is the surgeon’s knife; and the Tathāgata the surgeon.<br>M.ii.252-61.'],

The Buddha spent the day in Sunāparanta, and, on his way back, stopped on the banks of the riverNammadā. There the Nāgarājā paid him homage, and the Buddha left his footprint in the Nāga’s abode for him to worship. MA.ii.101f.; SA.iii.176; according to the latter account the Buddha spent seven days in Sunāparanta, at the Mankulārāma.<br>The people of Sunāparanta were reported as being fierce and violent (M.iii.268; S.iv.61f).<br>Sunāparanta was also the birthplace of Culla-Punna and Isidinna (Isidatta).<br>Sunāparanta is probably identical with Aparanta; the Burmese, however, identify it with the country on the right bank of the Irrawaddy River, near Pagan.

'sundarasamudda thera':['He was the son of a wealthy setthi of Rājagaha and was called Sundara on account of his beauty. While yet young, he realized the majesty of the Buddha, when he visited Rājagaha, and Samudda entered the Order. He once went to Sāvatthi, where he stayed with a friend, learning how to practise insight. On a festival day his mother thought of him and wept, seeing the sons of other families enjoying themselves with their wives. A courtesan offered to entice him back, and the mother promised that should she succeed she would make her Samudda’s wife and give her many gifts. The courtesan went, well attended, to Sāvatthi and took lodgings in a house to which Samudda frequently came for alms. She saw that he was well seen to and showed herself to him, decked and adorned and wearing golden slippers. One day, slipping off her sandals at the door, she saluted him with clasped hands as he passed, and invited him in with seductive manner.<br>Then the Thera, realizing that the heart of a worldling is unsteady, made then and there a supreme effort and attained arahantship (Thag.vss.459-65; ThagA.i.467f).<br>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.194ff.; cf. the story of Cullapindapātikatissa), Samudda accepted the invitation of the courtesan and went with her to the top floor of her seven storied house. There she provided him with a seat and practised her wiles. Samudda suddenly realized what he was doing and was much distressed.<br>The Buddha, seated in Jetavana, forty five leagues away, saw what was happening and smiled. On being asked by Ananda why he smiled, he said: ”A battle royal is being waged between Sundarasamudda and a courtesan, but Samudda will win.” So saying, he sent forth a ray of light to Samudda and preached to him. At the end of the sermon Samudda became an arahant.'],
'sundarika':['A brahmin, one of the Bhāradvājas.<br>Once, when he was performing Fire-rites on the banks of the Sundarikā, he looked round to see if there were anyone, to whom he could give what was left over from the oblations. He saw the Buddha seated under a tree, his head covered; (to rouse the brahmin’s curiosity and to prevent him from being repelled by the sight of a shaven head, says the Commentary) he approached him with the oblation and a water pitcher and addressed him. The Buddha uncovered his head. The sight of the shaven head at first made Sundarika draw back, but, realizing that some brahmins too were shaved, he questioned the Buddha about his birth. The Buddha explained to him that the important thing was not birth, but the leading of a good life. The brahmin was pleased and offered him the oblation, but the Buddha refused it, saying that he did not accept presents for chanting verses. He advised Sundarika to throw the food into the water, where there were no creatures, for who could digest food which had once been offered to a Buddha? The brahmin followed this advice and saw the water hiss and seethe with steam and smoke. Alarmed and with hair on end, he worshipped the Buddha, who preached to him. Sundarika entered the Order and became an arahant. S.i.167f. The account of the meeting between the Buddha and Sundarika is given in the Sutta Nipāta too (p.79 f.), but there the details differ greatly, though the topic of discussion is the same. Several additional verses are attributed to the Buddha regarding the true ”sacrifice.” The Commentary calls the SN. discourse the Pūralāsa Sutta (SNA.ii.400).<br>Sundarika-Bhāradvāja was so called from his habit of offering oblations on the banks of the Sundarikā (SA.i.181f). He is also mentioned (M.i.39f) as meeting the Buddha on the banks of the Bāhukā and asking him whether he bathed in that river, because it had the reputation of cleansing sins. The Buddha answered that purity was not to be won that way and preached to him the Vatthūpama Sutta.<br>According to the Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.iv.163), Sundarika was the brother of Akkosaka and Bilangika Bhāradvāja. There he is mentioned as having abused the Buddha in much the same way as Akkosaka.'],

When her father joined the Order at Mithilā and sent his charioteer home, Sundarī, with her mother’s consent, gave all away and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course. Then one day, with the leave of her teacher, she left Benares, accompanied by a large number of nuns, and, visiting the Buddha at Sāvatthi, uttered her ”lion’s roar.”<br>Thirty one kappas ago she was born in a clansman’s family, and seeing Vessabhu Buddha begging for alms, gave him a ladleful of food.<br>Fifty times she became the wife of Cakkavattis.

She would then spend it in a neighbouring monastery of the Paribbājakas and be seen again early in the morning coming from the direction of Jetavana. After some days, the heretics hired some villains to kill Sundarī and hide her body under a heap of rubbish near Jetavana. Then they raised a hue and cry and reported to the king that Sundarī was missing. A search was made, and her body was found near the Gandhakuti of the Buddha. Placing the body on a litter, they went about the streets of the city crying: ”Behold the deeds of the Sākyan monks!” As a result, the monks were subjected to great insults in the streets. For seven days the Buddha stayed in the Gandhakuti, not going to the city for alms, and Ananda even suggested that they should go to another city.<br>But the Buddha pointed out to him the absurdity of running away from a false report, and said that in seven days the truth would be known. The king employed spies, who found the murderers quarrelling among themselves after strong drink. They were seized and brought before the king, where they confessed their crime. The king sent for the heretics and compelled them to retract their accusations against the Buddha and his monks and to confess their own wickedness. They were then punished for murder.

Ananda seeing the Buddha smile and enquiring the reason for the smile, was told that, at the end of seven days, Suppabuddha would be swallowed up by the earth at the foot of his stairs. Suppabuddha overheard this, and had all his belongings carried to the seventh storey of his house. He removed the stairway, closed all doors, and set a strong guard. On the seventh day a state charger belonging to Suppabuddha broke loose. None could manage him except Suppabuddha, and he, desiring to seize the animal, moved towards the door. The doors opened of their own accord, the stairway returned to its place, and the strong guard threw him down the stairs.

But although Sakka revealed his identity, Suppabuddha rebuked him for a fool and said he had no need of more wealth, because he possessed already the seven stores of Ariyadhana (Noble Wealth). Sakka reported this conversation to the Buddha, who said that no power in the world would change Suppabuddha.

They became great friends, and agreed to bring about an alliance between the two royal houses. Suruci came to the throne of Mithilā and had a son called after himself. Brahmadatta became king of Benares and had a daughter, Sumedhā. A marriage was arranged between Suruci and Sumedhā, but Brahmadatta agreed to the alliance only on condition that Sumedhā should be Suruci’s only wife. Suruci accepted this condition, but, though Sumedhā lived in the palace for ten thousand years, she had no child. The people clamoured for an heir, but Suruci refused to take another queen, though Sumedhā herself obtained for him many thousands of women for his harem, sixteen thousand in all. Forty thousand years thus passed, but no child was born in the palace.<br>Then Sumedhā vowed an Act of Truth; Sakka’s throne was heated, and he asked the god Nalakāra to be born as Sumedhā’s son. Nalakāra reluctantly agreed. Then Sakka went to the king’s park disguised as a sage and offered to give any woman who was virtuous a son. ”If thou seek virtue, seek Sumedhā,” they said. He then went to the palace, and having made Sumedhā declare to him her virtue, he revealed his identity and promised her a son. In due course a son was born - Mahāpanāda. He grew up amid great splendour, and, when he was sixteen, the king built for him a grand palace.<br>It is said that Sakka sent Vissakamma as mason to help with the building. When the palace was completed, three ceremonies were held on the same day: the dedication of the palace, Mahāpanāda’s coronation and his marriage. The festival lasted for seven years, and the people began to grumble; but the king would not bring the festival to an end, for all this time Mahāpanāda had not once laughed, and the king said the feast could not end till he was made to laugh. Various people came to amuse him, among them two jugglers, Bhandukanna and Pandukanna; but it was not till Sakka sent a divine dancer to dance the ”Half body” dance, in which one half of the body danced while the rest stood still, that Mahāpanāda smiled.<br>The story was related on the occasion on which the Buddha gave Visākhā eight boons. One night there was a great storm, and the Buddha asked the monks to drench themselves in the rain as that would be the last great rain storm in his time. Together with them the Buddha appeared at Visākhā’s house, but as soon as they arrived on the threshold they were quite dry.<br>Bhaddaji is identified with Mahāpanāda, Visākhā with Sumedhā, Ananda with Vissakamma, and the Bodhisatta, was Sakka.

When the Buddha’s fame spread and his gains increased, Susīma’s followers suggested that he should learn the Buddha’s doctrine and preach it to the laity so that he and his followers, too, could reap some of the advantages.<br>Susīma agreed, and sought, Ananda, who, with the Buddha’s sanction, ordained him. In discussion with the monks who declared that they had obtained complete emancipation, etc., Susīma discovered that all of them did not possess supernatural powers, but thought they had gained nibbāna ”through insight.” He thereupon sought the Buddha to have the matter explained. The Buddha asked him many questions, and made him realize the truth of their statement. Susīma confessed his original purpose in joining the Order and asked for forgiveness (S.ii.119ff).

He therefore consulted his teacher, who confessed that neither did he understand the end, and advised him to seek the Pacceka Buddhas who were living in Isipatana. Susīma went there, entered the Order, and became a Pacceka Buddha. Soon afterwards he died, and Sankha, coming in search of his son, was told of what had happened.

'susīma jātaka':['1. Susīma Jātaka (No. 163). Susīma was king of Benares, and the Bodhisatta was his chaplain’s son. The chaplain had been master of ceremonies in the king’s elephant festival, and, as a result, had amassed great wealth. He died when his son was sixteen. Soon after, another elephant festival came round, and other brahmins obtained the king’s consent to be in charge of the ceremonies on the plea that the chaplain’s son was too young. When but four days remained before the festival, the Bodhisatta found his mother weeping. She explained that for seven successive generations their family had managed the elephant festival and that she felt the change deeply. The Bodhisatta discovered that a teacher expert in elephant lore lived in Takkasilā, two thousand yojanas away. He comforted his mother and proceeded to Takkasilā, reaching it in a single day. There he paid his fee of one thousand pieces to the teacher and explained the urgency of his mission. In one night the teacher taught him the three Vedas and the elephant lore, and the pupil could even excel his teacher in knowledge. The next morning he left early for Benares and reached it in one day.<br>On the day of the festival the Bodhisatta went in all his array before the king, and protested against the alienation of his rights. He challenged anyone to show his superiority over him in elephant lore, and nobody could be found to do so. The king then appointed him to conduct the ceremonies.<br>The story was related in reference to an attempt on the part of the heretics to prevent the people of Sāvatthi from giving alms to the Buddha. All the people of the city made a collection to hold an almsgiving, but they were divided in their allegiance, some wishing to entertain the Buddha, others favouring heretical teachers.

One day, when Susīma was taking part in a procession with the king, the queen mother saw him and fell desperately in love with him. The king, discovering this, made Susīma king in his place and the queen mother Susīma’s queen. But Susīma soon tired of royalty, and after establishing Brahmadatta once more on the throne, returned to the Himālaya in spite of his wife’s protests.

He used to go in disguise to Benares and play at dice with Tamba. The queen heard of his beauty and contrived to see him, and they fell in love with each other. The Garuda, by his power, raised a storm in the city and covered it with darkness, under cover of which he carried off Sussondī. The king was filled with grief, not knowing what had happened to his queen, as the Garuda continued to play at dice with him. Tamba therefore sent Sagga, a minstrel, to search for her. In the course of his wanderings, Sagga came to Bhārukaccha and took ship for Suvannabhūmi. In the middle of the ocean the sailors asked Sagga to play for them, but Sagga told them that his music would excite the big fish and trouble would ensue. The sailors, however, insisting, Sagga played, and the fish, maddened by the sound, splashed about, and the ship broke in two under the leap of a sea-monster. Sagga lay on a plank, which drifted to Nāgadīpa. There he saw and was recognized by Sussondī. Sussondī took him home, and, keeping him hidden from the Garuda, enjoyed herself with him when the Garuda was away playing at dice. Six weeks later a ship, with merchants for Benares, touched at Nāgadīpa, and Sagga returned home. He found Tamba playing at dice with the Garuda and recounted his adventures in song. The Garuda heard the song and understood the references.

The Nāga-king of the city kept guard over the vessel, but when the people crowded round him and said ”Su-sū,” he left it and went away. In the crowd was a minister’s son, and, when the vessel was opened and the child was discovered, he decided to adopt him. In due course the child grew up, and when the infuriated populace deposed the parricide Nāgadāsaka, they placed Susunāga on the throne.

He then went to the village of the head smith, stood outside his house, and sang the praises of his needle. The smith’s daughter, who was fanning her father, spoke to the Bodhisatta and asked him to go elsewhere, as no one in that village would want needles. The Bodhisatta answered that his were no ordinary needles, and the head smith asked him to show them. The Bodhisatta suggested that all the smiths be summoned, and in their presence he gave the needle-tube to the head smith. He thought that it was the needle itself, for he could find no end or tip. The tube was handed back to the Bodhisatta, who took out the first sheath. In this way the seven sheaths were removed, and when the needle was at last revealed he made the needle pierce the anvil and lie on the surface of a vessel of water.

The boar saw this, and, thinking that the lion was afraid of him, challenged him to a fight. The lion agreed to fight a week later. The boar was overjoyed, and told his relations of this. But they all frightened him and advised him to spend the next seven days rolling in the hermits’ dunghill. When the dirt was dry, he was to moisten his body with dew and go to the meeting place early, standing well to windward. This he did, and when the lion arrived and smelt the filth, the boar was allowed to go away uninjured.<br>The story was told in reference to an old and foolish monk.

Sāriputta, reading his thoughts, rose from his seat and walked away; so did Moggallāna. The laymen who were present were annoyed with the old monk and chased him away.

Tacchasūkara made all the preparations for a counter-attack, digging pits and training all the members of the herd in their various duties, and their several positions at the time of attack. Under his guidance they succeeded in killing the tiger and greedily devouring the corpse. Tacchasūkara was told that there was a sham ascetic who had helped the tiger to eat the boars. The herd attacked the ascetic, who climbed up a fig-tree, but they uprooted the tree and devoured him. They consecrated Tacchasūkara as their king, making him sit on a fig-tree, and sprinkling water on him from a conch-shell, with its spirals turned right-wise, which the ascetic had used for drinking.<br>Hence arose the custom of seating the king on a chair of fig wood and sprinkling him with water from a conch-shell at his coronation.

Having watched his father dig a pit, he asked what it was for, and was told that the useless old man was a burden to keep and that the pit was for him. The boy was silent, and when his father stopped to have a rest, he took up the spade and began to dig another hole.

The king agreed, but the chaplain, unable to restrain his wife’s conduct, told her about it. The news spread abroad, and all tawny-brown brahmins fled from the city, leaving, on the auspicious day, only the chaplain. The people demanded that he should be slain to avert ill-luck, and that his pupil, Takkāriya (the Bodhisatta), should be appointed in his place.

The horse-dealer sought the Bodhisatta’s advice, who suggested that the appraiser should be asked to value a measure of rice. The horse-dealer went to the king, and, in the presence of the court, asked the appraiser the value of one measure of rice. The man replied that it was worth all Benares and its suburbs. The ministers laughed, thus putting the king to shame. He dismissed the fool and reinstated the Bodhisatta.<br>The story was told in reference to Lāludāyi, who had a dispute with Dabba Mallaputta regarding the distribution of food tickets.

The Buddha tells Ananda how he himself had attained to Buddhahood by passing through the nine successive stages, the anupubbavihārā. These nine stages consist of the four jhānas, the fourāyatanas (ākāsānañcāyatana, etc.), and, as the crowning stage, the saññāvedayitanirodha (A.iv.438ff).<br>The Tapassu mentioned is evidently identical with the brother ofBhalluka mentioned above.<br>The Commentary (AA.ii.814) on this passage makes no attempt to distinguish him from any other.<br>tapassu<br>1. Tapassu, Tapussa.-A merchant of Ukkala. He and his friend, Bhalluka (Bhalliya), while on their way to Rājagaha, saw the Buddha at the foot of the Rājāyatana tree, in the eighth week after the Enlightenment. Urged by a deity, who had been their relation, they offered the Buddha rice-cakes and honey in a bowl provided by the Four Regent Gods. They became the first lay disciples of the Buddha, and their formula of Refuge contained no reference to the Sangha (Vin.i.3f; A.i.26; UdA.54; J.i.80).<br>According to the Theragāthā Commentary (i.48f), Tapassu and Bhalluka were brothers, sons of a caravan leader of Pokkharavatī. Some time later they visited the Buddha at Rājagaha, where he preached to them; Tapassu, thereupon, became a Sotāpanna, while Bhalluka entered the Order and became an arahant.<br>In the time of Sikhī Buddha they were brahmins of Arunavatī. Hearing that two caravan leaders, Ujita and Ojita, had given the first meal to the Buddha, they gave alms to the Buddha and his monks, and wished for a similar privilege for themselves under a future Buddha. In the time of Kassapa Buddha, they were sons of Gopāla-setthi, and for many years provided the monks with milk rice.<br>The Anguttara Commentary (AA.i.207f) says that the deity, who caused Tapassu and Bhalluka to give alms to the Buddha, was their mother in their previous birth. The Buddha gave them, for worship, eight handfuls of his hair, which he obtained by stroking his head. They took the hair with them to their city - which, according to this account, was Asitañjana - and there built a cetiya, from which rays of blue light issued on fast-days. Tapassu is called a dvevācikaupāsaka (AA.ii.696), and is included in a list of eminent upāsakas. A.iii.450.

Around it was the Tapodārāma.<br>It is said (SA.i.30f; Sp.ii.512) that the water of the river was hot because it flowed between two Lohakumbhi-nirayas, which existed under Rājagaha.

His father was the headman of the village Kitti in Rohana, and Theraputtābhaya, when sixteen, wielded a club thirty-eight inches round and sixteen cubits long.

His son, thereupon, came to be called Theraputtābhaya (Mhv.xxiii.2, 63ff). At the end of Dutthagāmāni’s campaigns, Abhaya took leave of the king and joined the Order, became an arahant, and lived with five hundred other arahants (Mhv.xxvi.2).

'thulla':['A nun. She was present when Mahā-Kassapa, in the company of Ananda, visited the nuns and preached to them. She expressed resentment that Kassapa should dare to preach in the presence of Ananda.

Pasenadi, king of Kosala, is mentioned as having come on two occasions to hear her preach, and was so pleased with her eloquence that he allowed her to persuade him to give her the costly upper garments he was wearing (Vin.iv.254-256).<br>She was greedy for possessions, and was later accused of misappropriating gifts intended for other nuns (Vin.iv.245-246, 258).<br>She was fond of the company of men, and frequented streets and cross-roads unattended that she might not be hindered in her intrigues with men (Vin.iv.270, 273).<br>She seems to have regarded with sympathy women who succumbed to temptation and to have tried to shield them from discovery (Vin.iv.216, 225, 230f).<br>She bribed dancers and singers to sing her praises. She could brook no rival, and especially disliked Bhaddā, whom she deliberately annoyed on more than one occasion (Vin.iv.283, 285, 287, 290, 292).<br>She was fractious and would wish for something, but when that was procured for her, would say it was something else she really wanted (Vin.iv.248, 250).<br>She was evidently an admirer of Ananda, and was greatly offended on hearing that Mahā Kassapa had called Ananda ”boy,” and gave vent to her displeasure at what she considered Kassapa’s presumption. But we are told that soon after that she left the Order (S.ii.219ff ).<br>She befriended Arittha when he was cast out of the Order (Vin.iv.218).

The prince in due course became king, and, as had been foreseen by his teacher, he was conspired against by his son, but saved his life by repeating the stanzas. The son was cast into prison, and set free only after the king’s death.<br>The story was related in reference to Bimbisāra’s great love for Ajātasattu, though soothsayers had predicted that the latter would kill his father (J.iii.121ff).'],

'thūpārāma':['1. Thūpārāma.-A monastery near the southern wall of Anurādhapura, erected by Devānampiyatissa. The spot was consecrated by the Buddha having sat there in meditation (Mhv.i.82) and also by former Buddhas doing likewise (Mhv.xv.86). The thūpa there was the first of its kind in Ceylon and enshrined the Buddha’s collar-bone. Miracles, said to have been ordained by the Buddha himself, attended its enshrinement (Mhv.xvii.30, 50). The monastery was built later than the thūpa, hence its name (Mhv.xvii.62). One of the eight saplings of the Bodhi-tree at Anurādhapura was planted in the grounds and exists to this day (Mhv.xix.61). The Cittasālā was to the east of the Thūpārāma, and on that site Sanghamittā was cremated (Mhv.xx.52). It was the monks of Thūpārāma who helped Thūlatthana to become king (Mhv.xxxiii.17).<br>Lañjatissa levelled the ground between the Thūpārāma and the Mahā Thūpa (about four hundred yards away), made a stone mantling for the thūpa, and built a smaller thūpa to the east of it, near which he built the Lañjakāsana-hall (Mhv.xxxiii.23f). Amandagāmāni added an inner verandah to the uposatha-hall in the monastery (Mhv.xxxv.3), while Vasabha placed lamps round the thūpa and built a new uposatha-house (Mhv.xxxv.80, 87, 91). Bhātika-Tissa erected another assembly-hall, while Gothābhaya made certain restorations (Mhv.xxxvi.4, 106). The Sanghapāla-parivena probably formed part of the monastery (Mhv.xxxvi.114).<br>Jetthatissa removed from the Thūpārāma the stone image placed there by Devānampiyatissa and set it up in Pācīnatissapabbata (Mhv.xxxvi.128).<br>The renegade monk Sanghamitta once threatened to destroy the Thūpārāma but was killed in the attempt (Mhv.xxxvii.27). Mahānāma provided a gold casing for the finial of the thūpa (Cv.xxxvii.207) and Dhātusena restored the thūpa (Mhv.xxxviii.70), while Aggabodhi II. effected extensive repairs, almost rebuilding the whole structure (Mhv.xlii.51ff). Dāthopatissa I. did the monastery great damage, as did Kassapa II., though he afterwards made amends (Mhv.xliv.133, 138, 148). Dāthopatissa II. gave the village of Punnali to the Thūpārāma (Mhv.xlv.28), and Mānavamma built a pāsāda (Mhv.xlvii.66). Aggabodhi VII. repaired the doors and transposed the pillars of the structure round the cetiya (Cv.xlviii.65). Mahinda II. placed a casing of gold and silver plates in the cetiya (Cv.xlviii.140), while Dappula II. covered the thūpaghara with golden bricks (Cv.xlix.81); both plates and bricks were later plundered by the Pandu king (Cv.l.35). The golden plates were restored by Udaya II. (Cv.li.128), and Sena Ilaṅga provided a building for the monks to the west of the Thūpārāma (Cv.lii.16). Rakkha Ilaṅga did likewise (Cv.liii.11). Mahinda IV. covered the cetiya with strips of gold and silver, provided a golden door for the vihāra and instituted a great festival (Cv.liv.42f). Vijayabāhu I., Parakkamabāhu I., and Vijayabāhu IV., successively, restored the buildings and effected necessary repairs (Cv.lx.56; lxxviii.107; lxxxviii.80). The road into Anurādhapura passed by the southern gate of the Thūpārāma, eastwards and then northwards (UdA.238; VibhA.449). From the Kadambanadī to the Thūpārāma the road lay through the gate of the Rājamātuvihāra (DA.ii.572).<br>Behind the Thūpārāma was the Mahejjāvatthu. It is said (Sp.i.86) that, at the time of Devānampiyatissa, there was in the Thūpārāma a shrine dedicated to the three Buddhas previous to Gotama.<br>2. Thūpārāma.-The name of a building in Pulatthipura. The date of erection and name of the founder are unknown, but it probably existed before the time of Parakkamabāhu I (Cv.lx.56; Cv.

But the Bodhisatta comforted them and kept them in good humour until they were rescued by his nephew, Senaka, who set fire to the village, distracting the attention of the people, thus allowing the monkeys to escape.<br>The story was related in illustration of the Bodhisatta’s sagacity (J.ii.76f).<br>Senaka is identified with Mahānāma the Sākiyan. v.l.

'tipallatthamiga jātaka':['Once the Bodhisatta was born as a stag, leader of a herd of deer. Rāhula was his sister’s son and was entrusted to him, that he might learn the ”deer’s tricks.” The young stag followed his instruction diligently and one day, being caught in a net, he feigned death and so made his escape.<br>The story was told in reference to Rāhula. Once, at the Aggālavacetiya, the Buddha, noticing that monks were in the habit of sleeping with novices in the preaching-hall after the sermon, he passed a rule making this a pāciṭṭiya-offence. As a result, Rāhula could find no lodging and spent the night in the Buddha’s jakes, not wishing to transgress the rule. The Buddha, discovering this, assembled the monks and blamed them for their thoughtlessness, for if they thus treated his son, what might they not do to the other novices. The rule about lodgings was thereupon modified. The story was related to show Rāhula’s diligence in following rules (J.i.160ff; cp.

Departed spirits haunt their old dwelling places and their compassionate kinsmen should bestow on them in due time, food, drink, etc. and also give gifts to the monks in their name. Thus will they be happy (Khp., p.6).<br>The Sutta was preached on the third day of the Buddha’s visit to Rājagaha. On the previous night, Petas had made a great uproar in Bimbisāra’s palace. In the time of Phussa Buddha, they had been workmen entrusted with the task of distributing alms to the Buddha and his monks, but they had been negligent in their duties and had appropriated some of the gifts for themselves. As a result, they suffered for a long period in purgatory and became Petas in the time of Kassapa Buddha. Kassapa told them that in the future, Bimbisāra, who had once been their kinsman, would entertain the Buddha Gotama and make over the merit to them. They had long waited for this occasion and when Bimbisāra failed to fulfil their expectations, they made great outcry.<br>The Buddha explained this to Bimbisāra, who thereupon gave alms in the name of the Petas, thus making them happy. It was on this occasion that the Sutta was preached. KhpA.202ff; cp. PvA.19ff.'],

'tissa':['1. Tissa.-The seventeenth of the twenty-four Buddhas.<br>He was born in the Anomā pleasaunce in Khemaka. His father was Janasandha (v.l. Saccasandha) and his mother Padumā. He lived the household life for seven thousand years, in three palaces - Guhāsala, Nārī (Nārisa) and Nisabha He left the world on a horse named Sonuttara. For eight months he practised austerities. After a meal of milk rice given by the daughter of Vīrasetthi of Vīragāma, he sat on grass given by a yavapālaka named Vijitasangāma He attained Buddhahood under an asana tree. He preached his first sermon at Yasavatī to Brahmadeva and Udaya (Udayana) of Hamsavatī, who later became his chief disciples. His attendant was Samaṅga (Sambhava) His chief patrons being Sambala and Siri among men and Kisāgotamī and Upasenā among women. His chief women disciples were Phussā and Sudattā. His body was sixty cubits high After a life of one hundred thousand years he died at Nandārāma (Sunandārāma) in Sunandavatī. His body was cremated and a thūpa was erected three leagues in height. Bu.xviii.1ff; BuA.188ff; J.i.40.2. Tissa.-The ninth future Buddha. See Anāgasavamsa, p.40.<br>3. Tissa.-One of the two chief disciples of Vipassī Buddha (Bu.xx.28; J.i.41; D.ii.4). He was the son of the purohita Bandhumatī, and the Buddha’s first sermon was preached to him and Khanda. BuA.196.<br>4. Tissa.-One of the two chief disciples of Dīpankara Buddha. Bu.ii.213; J.i.29; Mbv.5.<br>5. Tissa.-An aggasāvaka (great disciple) of Kassapa Buddha. He was the Buddha’s brother and, having renounced the household, became an ascetic. On hearing that Kassapa had become Buddha, he visited him but expressed great disappointment on discovering that he ate flesh food (āmagandha). The Buddha taught him that āmagandha was not really flesh but the kilesas which corrupt the heart, and he preached to him the āmagandha Sutta. Tissa immediately entered the Order and became an aggasāvaka (Bu.xxv.39; SNA.i.280-2, 293; D.ii.4). Tissa’s father was born as Subhadda in this age. Ap.i.101.<br>6. Tissa.-A monk who was reborn as a Brahmā with great iddhi-powers. Moggallāna visited him soon after his birth in the Brahma-world and asked him questions about devas and Brahmas who were assured of salvation (A.iii.331; iv.75ff). He was evidently the Tissa mentioned as being present at the Mahāsamaya. D.ii.261; DA.ii.692.<br>7. Tissa.-A friend of Metteyya. They together visited the Buddha at Jetavana and, having listened to his teaching, entered the Order. Metteyya retired with his teacher into the forest and not long after became an arahant. Tissa lived in Sāvatthi and when his elder brother died, he went home and was persuaded by his relations to return to the lay life. Later, Metteyya, passing through the village with the Buddha, during a journey, visited Tissa and brought him once more to the Buddha. The Buddha preached to them the Tissa-Metteyya Sutta, at the end of which Tissa became a Sotāpanna, later attaining arahantship. SN., p.160f; SNA.ii.535f, NidA.184.<br>8. Tissa.-The personal name of Metteyya, friend of Tissa (7). Metteyya was his gotta-name by which he became known (SNA.ii.536; NidA.184). In the Sutta Nipāta (vs.814) he is called Tissa-Metteyya.<br>9. Tissa-Metteyya.-A disciple ofBāvarī. He visited the Buddha with his colleagues and when the Buddha answered his questions, he, and his thousand pupils became arahants. Tissa was his personal name and Metteyya that of his clan. SN., vs.1040-2; SNA.ii.588.<br>10. Tissa.-An Elder of Sāvatthi. He once received a length of coarse cloth as a gift and handed it to his sister to be made into a robe. She had the cloth pounded and spun into fine yarn and made of it a soft robe-cloth. At first Tissa would not accept it but was prevailed upon to do so and had it made into a soft robe by skilled robe-makers. He died on the night it was finished and, as a result of his fancy for it, was reborn as a louse in the robe. After his death, the monks wished to divide the robe but the louse started shouting. The Buddha, hearing this by his power of divine audience, asked the monks to lay the robe aside for seven days. At the end of that period, the louse was reborn in the Tusita world. DhA.iii.341ff.<br>11. Tissa.-A monk. When the Buddha declared that in four months he would pass away, many monks were greatly excited, collecting in groups, not knowing what to do. But Tissa remained aloof, determined to win arahantship before the Buddha’s death. The others, misunderstanding him, reported to the Buddha that Tissa had no love for him, but the Buddha, having questioned him, praised his earnestness. DhA.iii.267f.<br>12. Tissa Thera.-An arahant. He belonged to a brahmin family of Rājagaha and, having attained great proficiency in the Vedas, became a teacher of five hundred young men. When the Buddha visited Rājagaha, Tissa was so struck by his majesty that he joined the Order, later winning arahantship. The Theragāthā contains verses uttered by him regarding certain monks who were jealous of his great renown.<br>In the time of Piyadassī Buddha, Tissa was an ascetic. Seeing the Buddha in samādhi in a forest-grove, he built over him an arbour of silo flowers and for seven days paid him homage. (Thag.vv.153-4; ThagA.i.272f).<br>He is evidently identical with Sālamandapiya of the Apadāna (ii.431f).<br>13. Tissa.-A rājā of Roruva. He was an ”unseen” ally of Bimbisāra and, as such, sent him various gifts. The king sent him in return a painted panel on which was depicted the life of the Buddha and a gold plate specially inscribed with the Paticcasamuppāda. On seeing these, Tissa’s mind was filled with agitation and, giving up his title, he came to Rājagaha as a monk and lived in theSappasondika cave, from there visiting the Buddha, and soon afterwards becoming an arahant.<br>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a chariot-maker and gave the Buddha a stool made of sandalwood. Fifty-seven kappas ago he was four times king under the name of Santa (Bhavanimmita) (Thag.97; ThagA.i.199f). He is probably identical with Phalakadāyaka of the Apadāna (i.174).<br>14. Tissa Thera.-An arahant. Son of the Buddha’s paternal aunt, Amitā. He entered the Order and dwelt in a woodland settlement, but he was proud of his rank and irritable and captious in his conduct. He once came to the Buddha in tears because his colleagues had teased him on account of his talkativeness (S.ii.282; MA.i.289). On another occasion, the Buddha, with his celestial eye, saw Tissa sleeping with open mouth during the siesta and, sending a ray of glory, woke him. Tissa’s heart was filled with anguish and when he confessed to his colleagues his mental laziness and distaste for religion, they brought him to the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him the Tissa Sutta, at the end of which he became an arahant (Thag.v.39; but see v.1162; S.iii.106f; ThagA.i.105).<br>In the time of Tissa Buddha he swept the leaves from the foot of the Bodhi-tree. He is evidently identical with Bodhisammajjaka of the Apadāna (Ap.ii.457f).<br>The Dhammapada Commentary (i.31ff) calls him Thullatissa. He entered the Order when old and became fat through idleness. He spent most of his time in the Waiting-hall draped in rich robes. Monks, taking him for a Mahā Thera, begged the privilege of performing various services for him, such as massaging his feet. But when they discovered his attainments, they reviled him and he sought the Buddha. The Buddha, however, asked him to obtain their pardon for having failed to show them due honour, and when he refused, related to him the story of Nārada and Devala.<br>15. Tissa.-A novice. He was a gatekeeper’s son and, coming with some carpenters to Sāvatthi, joined the Order. He was constantly finding fault with the food and other offerings, even those given by Anāthapindika, and he boasted of the riches enjoyed by his kinsfolk. His colleagues made enquiries and, discovering the truth about his antecedents, reported him to the Buddha who preached the Katāhaka Jātaka (q.v.) to show his similar tendencies in the past (DhA.iii.367). Tissa was identified with Katāhaka of the Jātaka. J.i.455.<br>16. Tissa.-A monk. He was called Kosambivāsī Tissa. He spent the rainy season at Kosambī and, on his departure, his supporter gave him three robes and other offerings; he, however, refused them saying that he had no novice to look after them. The layman immediately gave his son, then seven years old, to be his novice. The boy attained arahantship in the Tonsure-hall. While on his way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha, Tissa accidentally blinded the novice by hitting his eye with a fan at dawn. The Elder was filled with remorse and, falling at the boy’s feet, asked his pardon. But the answer was that there was no fault to pardon, the accident was due to samsāra. When the matter was reported to the Buddha he said that such was the nature of arahants. They felt no resentment. At the end of the discourse, Tissa became an arahant (DhA.ii.182ff).<br>17. Tissa.-A monk, called Asubhakammika-Tissa. He is mentioned in the Commentaries (VibhA.270) as an example of a good friend, devoted to the contemplation of asubha, association with whom helps one to get rid of lust. His teacher was Mahātissa of Kotapabbata-vihāra. MT.553.<br>18. Tissa.-A master of writing (lekhācariya). Even after his death he was known by reason of his writing. Mil., p.70; see J.R.A.S.xii.159.<br>19. Tissa.-One of the chief lay patrons of Padumuttara Buddha. Bu.xi.26.<br>20. Tissa.-A monk known as āraddhavipassaka-Tissa. While walking about he saw a lotus open at the rising of the sun. Immediately afterwards, he heard a slave-girl singing; her song told of how men are subject to death just as the lotus opens to the sun. Tissa thereupon developed insight and became an arahant. SNA.ii.397.<br>21. Tissa.-Uncle of Pandukābhaya. He administered the kingdom when his elder brother, Abhaya, gave up the government. He was killed by Pandukābhaya. Mhv.x.51, 70.<br>22. Tissa-Kontiputta.-An Elder of Asoka’s time, a disciple of Mahāvaruṇa and brother of Sumitta. He was the son of a kinnarī calledKuntī. He died of a bite by a venomous insect. Asoka was grieved on learning that Tissa’s death was due to his failure to obtain ghee in his illness. Mhv.v.213ff.<br>23. Tissa-kumāra.-Brother ofAsoka and his vice-regent. He once asked Asoka why monks were not joyful and gay and Asoka, in order to teach him the reason, gave him the throne for a week, saying that at the end of the week he would be put to death. Tissa then realised that monks, who had the constant consciousness of death, could not be merry.<br>He later became a monk under Yonaka Mahādhammarakkhita and lived in the Asokārāma, where he prevented the murder of the theras by the minister sent by Asoka to make the monks hold the uposatha together. He became an arahant and, on account of his love of solitude, came to be known as Ekavihāriya. Thag.vv.537-46; ThagA.i.503f; Mhv.v.33, 60, 154ff, 241; SA.iii.125.<br>24. Tissa.-King of Kalyāni and father of Vihāramahādevī (Mhv.xxii.13ff). His brother Ayya-Uttika entered into an intrigue with the queen and was banished. He sent the queen a letter through an attendant to an arahant who was in the habit of visiting the palace. This letter fell into the hands of the king who suspected the arahant himself, owing to a similarity in his writing to that of the intriguer. The king ordered the arahant to be killed and cast into the sea. The devas, being offended, caused the sea to overflow the land. The total destruction of the country was only averted by the king sending his daughter Devī (afterwards Vihāramahadevī), to sea in a golden boat. The Rasavāhini, however, says he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil; see Telakatāhagāthā.<br>Tissa’s father was Mutasiva and his grandfather Uttiya. MT.431.<br>25. Tissa.-A minister of Dutthagāmāni. When the latter fled from Saddhātissa, Tissa joined him and he gave him his own food during the flight. But the food was ultimately given to a monk (see Tissa 26) who accepted their invitation to the meal. (For details see Mhv.xxiv.22ff; AA.i.365). It was probably the mother of this Tissa who, we are told (Vsm., p.63), used a cloth worth one hundred to wipe away the impurities of her son’s birth, which cloth she afterwards threw out on to the Tālaveli road hoping that it might prove useful to a pāmsukūlika monk.<br>26. Tissa.-A thera in Piyangudīpa. He it was who accepted the meal given by Dutthagāmāni while fleeing from his brother. Mhv.xxiv.25.<br>27. Tissa.-A brahmin youth of Rohana who rebelled against Vattagāmāni in the fifth year of his reign. At that time Damilas invaded Ceylon and Vattagāmāni sent word to Tissa asking him to fight them, and take the throne for himself; Tissa did, but was conquered by them (Mhv.xxxiii.38ff). See also Brāhmana-Tissa.<br>28. Tissa.-A monk of Kambugallaka; he was very learned and helped to reconcile Vattagāmāni and his discontented ministers (Mhv.xxxiii.71, 75). Later, the ministers built several vihāras - the Mūlavokāsa, the Sāliyārāma, the Pabbatārāma and the Uttaratissārāma - and handed them over to Tissa. Ibid., 91.<br>29. Tissa.-A minister of Vattagāmāni; he built the Uttamtissārāma. Mhv.xxxiii.91.<br>30. Tissa.-Son of Mahācūla and king of Ceylon (9-12 A.D.). He was poisoned by his wife Anulā. Mhv.xxxiv.15ff.<br>31. Tissa.-A paramour of Queen Anulā. He was a wood-carrier and was therefore called Dārubhatika-Tissa. He reigned for one year and one month and built a bathing-tank in the Mahāmeghavana. He was poisoned by Anulā. Mhv.xxxiv.22ff.<br>32. Tissa.-A monk of the Dakkhinārāma, for whom Mahāsena built the Jetavana-vihāra. Mhv.xxxvii.32, 38.<br>33.

Tissa.-Nephew of Khallātanāga and son of Sumanadevī, step-sister to the king. With his brothers, Abhaya and Uttara, he conspired to kill the king. But the conspiracy failed and they committed suicide. MT.612.<br>35. Tissa.-An artisan (kammāraputta), a previous incarnation of Sāliya. He lived in Mundagangā and receiving one day as wages the flesh of a boar, he had it cooked by his wife. When the meal was ready he announced alms; the theras Dhammadinna, Godhiya-Mahātissa, Mahānāga of Samuddavihāra, Mahānāga of Kālavallimandapa, Mahāsaṅgharakkhita, Dhammagutta, Mahānāga of Bhātiyavanka and Maliyamahādeva appeared to accept the alms. MT.605f.<br>36. Tissa.-A monk resident in Lonagiri (Lenagiri). He once saw fifty monks, on their way to Nāgadipa on a pilgrimage, returning from their alms-rounds in Mahākhīragāma, with their bowls empty. Asking them to wait, he returned in a little while with his bowl of milk rice which proved more than enough for the whole company. Seeing their astonishment, he explained that since he had begun to practise the sārānīya-dhammā, his bowl had never lacked food.<br>At the Giribhaṇḍamahāpūjā at Cetiyapabbata, Tissa wished to have for himself two shawls, the most precious things there. He declared his wish in the presence of others and the king, on being informed, determined that Tissa should not have them, but every time he put out his hand to take the robes, they slipped away, and others took their place. In the end the robes were given to Tissa (DA.ii.534f; MA.i.545).<br>37. Tissa.-A Thera of Sāvatthi, better known as Kutumbiyaputta-Tissa. He renounced forty crores of wealth and became a monk dwelling in the forest. His younger brother’s wife sent five hundred ruffians to kill him. He begged them to spare his life for one night and broke his thigh-bone with a stone as token that he would not attempt to escape. During the night he overcame his pain and, dwelling on his virtues, became an arahant (MA.i.188f; DA.iii.747; Vsm.48).<br>38. Tissa.-A Thera of Sāketa. He refused to answer questions, saying that he had no time. On being asked, ”Can you find time to die?” he felt ashamed, and going to the Kanikāravālikasamudda-vihāra, instructed monks of varying grades during the rainy season, rousing great enthusiasm among the populace by his preaching (MA.i.350f; DA.iii.1061).<br>39. Tissa.-A monk of Kotapabbata.<br>40. Tissa.-A minister.

Tissa.-A novice of Pañcaggalalena. While travelling through the air he heard the daughter of the artisan of Girigāma singing, after having bathed with her companions in a lotus-pond. Being attracted by the sound, he lost his power of travelling through the air. MA.i.353; SNA.i.70.<br>42. Tissa.-A novice of Tissamahā-vihāra. He complained to his teacher of his distaste for the Order and the latter took him to Cittalapabbata. There, with great effort, Tissa built for himself a cave and while lying there during the night, became an arahant, dying the next day. A thūpa called the Tissa-thera-cetiya was erected over his relics and this was still in existence in Buddhaghosa’s day (MA.i.312f).<br>43. Tissa.-An attendant of King Saddhā-Tissa. The king, wishing to eat pheasants, asked Tissa to procure some, having first tested him by threatening to have him executed if he refused to kill fowl for the king’s table. Tissa, even when led to the executioner’s block, refused to kill the birds. The king was thus satisfied that Tissa would not kill pheasants for him. The next day, Tissa, seeing a fowler hawking some dead pheasants, obtained them for the king (SA.iii.49ff; AA.i.262).<br>44.

'ubbarī':['1. Ubbarī.-A princess. In the time of Kakusandha she was a hen. Having heard a monk repeat a formula of meditation, she was born as a royal princess and named Ubbarī. Seeing a heap of maggots in the privy, she meditated thereon and entered the first jhāna and was born in the Brahma-world. In the time of Gotama Buddha she was reborn as a sow in Rājagaha, and the Buddha, seeing her, smiled and related her past to Ananda. Later she was born in the royal household in Suvannabhūmi, then, in succession, in a horse-dealer’s house in Suppāraka and in a mariner’s household in Kāvīra. Then she was reborn in a nobleman’s house in Anurādhapura, and again in the village of Bokkanta in South Ceylon, as the daughter of a householder named Sumana. She was called Sumanā, after her father. When her father moved to the village of Mahāmuni in Dīghavāpi, Lakuntaka Atimbam, prime minister of Dutthagāmāni, met her and married her, and she went to live in Mahāpunna.<br>Having recollected her past births from some words uttered by the Elder Anula of Kotipabbata, she joined the Order of Pañcabalaka nuns. At Tissamahārāma she heard the Mahā Satipatthāna Sutta and became a Sotāpanna. Later, having heard the āsīvisopama Sutta in Kallaka-Mahāvihāra, she attained arahantship.

Ubbarī.-The wife of Cūlanī Brahmadatta, king of Kapila in the Pañcāla kingdom. She was a daughter of a poor woman in the village, and the king met her while on his wanderings disguised as a tailor, which disguise he assumed in order to find out news of the people for himself. She was given the name Ubbarī on the day of her marriage, and Cūlanī made her his chief queen. When the king died, she went to the cemetery day after day, lamenting for her dead husband and refusing to be comforted. One day the Bodhisatta, who was an ascetic in Himavā, noticed her with his divine eye and appeared before her. Having heard her story, he pointed out to her that eighty-six thousand kings of Pañcāla, all bearing the name of Cūlanī Brahmadatta, had been burnt in that very spot and that she had been the queen of them all. Thereupon, Ubbarī abandoned her grief and renounced the world. She developed thoughts of loving-kindness and in due course was reborn in the Brahma-world (Pv.32; PvA.160-8).<br>She is probably to be identified with the queen of Cūlanī Brahmadatta, king of Pañcāla, mentioned in the Mahā-Ummagga Jātaka (J.vi.473, 475), in which case her original name was Nandā-devī. According to the scholiast (J.vi.473), Ubbarī is not a proper name but means any women of the court (orodha).<br>3. Ubbarī.-Queen Consort of Assaka, king of Potali in the Kāsi kingdom. She was extremely beautiful and, when she died, the king had her body embalmed and placed in a coffin which was put under his bed.

But the girl died soon afterwards, and Ubbirī, distracted, went daily to the charnel-field. One day, as she sat lamenting on the bank of the Aciravatī, the Buddha appeared before her in a ray of glory. Having listened to her story, the Master pointed out to her that in that same burial-ground, eighty-four thousand of her daughters, all named Jīvā, had been burnt. Pondering on the Master’s words, she developed insight and became an arahant.<br>When she was a young girl in Hamsavatī in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, she was one day left alone in the house.

When the boy had gone, the fisherman went into the water to drag the fish, but he struck against the snag and was blinded in both eyes. Moreover a robber stole his clothes from the bank and his wife was taken before the village chief and fined and beaten for quarrelling.

The king’s servants came back and reported that what the woman wanted was a husband. When the king had her summoned and questioned, she admitted that it was so. Being pleased with the woman, the king asked in what relationship the three prisoners stood to her. She answered that one was her husband, one her brother and one her son. When the king asked which of the three she wished to have released, she chose the brother, because, she said, the two others were replaceable.

'ucchu':['1. Ucchu-vimāna, also called Ucchudāyikā-vimāna. A girl, who belonged to a pious family in Rājagaha, used to give to holy men half of anything she received. She was given in marriage to a family of unbelievers. One day she saw Moggallāna going about for alms, and having invited him to her house she gave him a piece of sugar cane which had been set aside for her mother-in-law, whose approval of the gift she hoped to win. But when the mother-in-law heard of what had happened in her absence, she flew into a rage and struck the girl with a stool. The girl died immediately and was born in Tāvatimsa.<br>Later she visited Moggallāna and revealed her identity. Her palace came to be called Ucchudāyikā-vimāna. Vv.24f; VvA.124ff.<br>2.

Once he was going along the road eating a sugar cane and carrying a bundle of sugar canes. Behind him came another man of good conduct, with a child. The child, seeing the sugar cane, begged for some of it with great lamentations. The good man wishing to console the child, walked up to the sugar cane-eater and tried to make friends. His efforts were, however, unsuccessful, and when he begged for a piece of sugar cane for the child, the man sulkily threw him a bit from the end of the sugar cane. This man, after his death, was born as a peta. Around him was a forest of sugar canes, but whenever he attempted to eat any of them he got badly bruised and wounded. One day Moggallāna saw him, and having discovered his antecedents told him about his past profitless life. He made the peta get for him a piece of sugar cane, which he offered to the Buddha and the monks. As a result of this, the peta was reborn in Tāvatimsa. Pv., pp.61f; PvA.257ff.'],

When the king fell asleep the women wandered about the park and, seeing Pindoḷa, they went up to him and he preached to them. The king, on waking, was enraged to find the women absent and, on learning the cause, went to Pindoḷa and questioned him. Pindoḷa, knowing that the king had no wish to learn, sat silent.

When questioned, the jackal said that he merely obeyed the ”law” of his race, which was to foul the place where they had drunk. The Bodhisatta warned him not to repeat the offence.<br>The story was related concerning the fouling of the water at Isipatana by a jackal.

When his parents wished him to marry, he refused, but in the end, yielding to their entreaties, he made a woman’s image in gold and desired them to find a wife who resembled it. Udayabhaddā alone could rival the image, so she was wedded to Udayabhadda. They lived together in chastity and, in due course, when Udayabhadda died, the princess became queen. The king was born as Sakka, and honouring a promise he had made to the princess to return and announce to her the place of his birth, he visited her as soon as he remembered her, and, before revealing himself, tested her in various ways.

'udāyibhadda':['Son of Ajātasattu. When Ajātasattu, after the death of his father, paid his first visit to the Buddha and saw the Buddha seated amidst the monks in a scene of perfect calm and silence, his first thought was: ”Would that my son, Udāyibhadda, might have such calm as this.” (D.i.50).<br>Buddhaghosa explains (DA.i.153) this thought by saying that Ajātasattu feared that his son might follow his own example and kill him as he had killed his own father.

Udāyī Sutta.-Ananda reports to the Buddha that Udāyī preached to a very large following of laymen. The Buddha says that this is not an easy thing to do; he who preaches to a large audience must see, (1) that his talk has a logical reference, (2) that it has reasoning (pariyāya), (3) that it is inspired by kindness (dayā), (4) that it is not for worldly gain, (5) that it causes pain to no one.

'uddaka':['One of the teachers under whom Gotama, after leaving the world and before he became the Buddha, received instruction (J.i.66, 81). Uddaka taught him the doctrine which had been realised and proclaimed by his father Rāma, which was the attainment of the state of ”neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness” (corresponding to the fourth Jhāna). When Gotama had mastered this, Uddaka made him more than his own equal by setting him over the whole company of his disciples as their teacher. But Gotama, finding this doctrine unsatisfactory, abandoned it (M.i.165ff., 240ff.; DhA.i.70-1).<br>The Buddha evidently had a high regard for Uddaka-Rāmaputta, for after the Enlightenment, when looking for someone to whom the Dhamma might be preached, and who was capable of realising its import at once, his thoughts turned to Uddaka, but Uddaka was already dead (Vin.i.7).<br>In the Vassakāra Sutta of the Anguttara Nikāya (ii.180) it is mentioned that King Eleyya, together with his bodyguard, Yamaka, Moggalla and others, were followers of Rāmaputta and that they held him in great esteem.<br>In the Samyutta Nikāya (iv.83f) the Buddha says that Uddaka claimed to be ”versed in lore and to have conquered everything, digging out the root of Ill,” though he had no justification for such a claim.<br>Again, in the Pāsādika Sutta (D.iii.126-7), the Buddha tells Cunda that when Uddaka said ”seeing, he seeth not,” he had in mind a man who saw the blade of a sharpened razor but not its edge - a low, pagan thing to speak about.<br>In the Sanskrit books Uddaka-Rāmaputta is called Udraka.

In the course of their travels he and his followers came to Benares, where they received great favours from the people. Attracted by his reputation, the king once visited him with the royal chaplain. On that occasion Uddālaka arranged that he and his followers should feign to be very holy men given up to various austerities.

Three times he told the Buddha that he had heard that the laying down (ādhāna) of the fire and the setting up (ussāpaṇa) of the sacrificial post bore great fruit. Three times the Buddha agreed that it was so, and Uggatasarīra was about to conclude that the Buddha approved of his sacrifice, when Ananda intervened and suggested that the Buddha should be asked to explain his meaning and to give his advice as to the efficacy of the sacrifice. The Buddha thereupon declared that there were three fires to be cast off: rāga, dosa and moha; and three fires that should be honoured: āhuneyyaggi, gahapataggi and dakkhineyyaggi.

Thirty-five kappas ago he was a king named Arunabala (Thag.v.67; ThagA.i.118f).<br>He is probably identical with Kanikārapupphiya of the Apadāna (Ap.i.203).<br>3. Ujjaya.-A brahmin. He once went to the Buddha and asked him if he thought well of sacrifices. The Buddha replied that he was opposed to sacrifices which involved the slaughter of animals, but sacrifices not necessitating butchery, such as, for instance, a long-established charity, an oblation for the welfare of the family, had his approval (A.ii.42).<br>The same Nikāya (A.iv.285f) records another visit of Ujjaya wherein he tells the Buddha that he wishes to observe a period of retreat (upavāsa), and asks for a teaching which will bring welfare both in this world and in the next. See below Ujjaya Sutta 2.'],
'ujjaya sutta':['1. Ujjaya Sutta.-Records the questions asked by the brahmin Ujjaya regarding sacrifice, and the Buddha’s answer. See above Ujjaya 3. A.ii.42.<br>2. Ujjaya Sutta.-Ujjaya’s request to the Buddha (referred to above under Ujjaya 3) for a teaching which would bring him welfare in both worlds and the Buddha’s reply thereto, detailing four qualities which would bring prosperity in this world - the accomplishments of exertion (utthānasampādā), and of protection (ārakkhasampadā), friendship with the good (kalyānamittatā), and regular living (samajīvitā) - and four others for bringing happiness in the next - viz., the four sampadā (accomplishments) of sīla (morality), citta (concentration and meditation), cāga (generosity), and paññā (higher wisdom). A.iv.285-9.'],
'ujjenī':['1. Ujjenī.-The capital ofAvanti. In the Buddha’s time, Canda-Pajjota (Vin.i.276; DhA.i.192) was king of Ujjenī and there was friendly intercourse between that city and Magadha, whose king was SeniyaBimbisāra. After Bimbisāra’s death, however, Pajjota seems to have contemplated a war against Ajātasathu. See M.iii.7.<br>There was an old trade-route from Ujjenī to Benares and the merchants of the two cities showed healthy rivalry not only in trade, but also in matters of culture. See, e.g., J.ii.248ff., where the merchants of Benares compare their musician Guttila with Mūsila, the chief fiddler of Ujjenī.<br>It was while going with a caravan to Ujjenī, that Sona Kutikanna (4) met the Peta, whose words made him decide to renounce household life (UdA.307f).<br>The road taken by Bāvarī’s disciples ran through Ujjenī (Sn.v.1011).<br>Ujjenī was also the birthplace of Mahā Kaccāna (ThagA.i.483), of Isidāsī (Thig.v.405), of Abhaya (ThagA.41) and of the courtesan Padumavatī, mother of Abhayā (ThigA.39).<br>Before succeeding to his father’s throne at Pātaliputta, Asoka reigned for several years as Viceroy at Ujjenī, and it was during this period that Mahinda andSanghamittā were born (Mhv.xiii.10ff; Mbv.99; Sp.i.70).<br>Mahinda spent six months in Dakkhinagiri Vihāra in Ujjenī, prior to his visit to Ceylon (Mhv.xiii.5).<br>From the same vihāra forty thousand monks were present, under the leadership of Mahā Sangharakkhita, at the foundation of the Mahā Thūpa in Anurādhapura (Mhv.xxix.35).<br>The Jātakas speak of Ujjenī as having been the capital of Avanti from very ancient times. E.g., in J.iv.390, where Avanti Mahārāja rules in Ujjenī as capital of Avanti. But in the Mahāgovinda Sutta (D.ii.235), Māhissatī is mentioned as the capital of Avanti. Perhaps Māhissatī lost its importance later and gave place to Ujjenī, for we find Māhissatī mentioned just before Ujjenī among the places passed by Bāvarī’s pupils on their way to Sāvatthi (Sn.v.1011).<br>Ujjenī is identical with the Greek Ozene, about 77° E. and 23° N. (Bud. India, p.40; see also CAGI, 560, and Beal ii.270 for Hiouen Thsang’s description of it).<br>2. Ujjenī.-A city in Ceylon, founded by Vijaya’s minister Accutagāmī (Dpv.ix.36; Mhv.vii.45).<br>3. Ujjenī.-A township (nigama), the residence of the banker’s daughter Rucinandā, who gave a meal of milk-rice to Padumuttara Buddha just before his Enlightenment (BuA.158).'],
'ujjhānasaññikā':['The name given to a group of devas who once visited the Buddha at Jetavana late at night. They charged the Buddha with inconsistency, but later, begging his forgiveness, they were pardoned by him (S.i.23-5). Buddhaghosa (SA.i.50f ) says that they did not belong to any separate deva-world but were given this name by the Theras of the Council on account of their captious remarks. They had heard the Buddha praise his monks for self-denying practices while he himself wore raiment of silk, fine cloth or linen, ate food worthy of a rājā, dwelt in a Fragrant Cell like unto a deva-mansion and used good medicines.'],
'ujjuhāna':['A hill thickly covered with jungle and abounding in streams which get overfull during the rains and make living on the hill uncomfortable.<br>According to others, Ujjuhana is the name of a bird, capable of bearing cold and rain with comfort. Thag.597; ThagA.i.536.'],
'ujuññā':['A district and a town in Kosala.<br>Once when the Buddha was staying at the Deer Park in Kannakatthala in the neighbourhood of the city,Pasenadi, who happened to be at Ujuññā on business, visited the Buddha. On this occasion was preached theKannakatthala Sutta (M.ii.125ff; MA.ii.757).<br>It was here too that Nigantha Kassapa came to see the Buddha. This visit is recorded in theKassapa Sīhanāda Sutta.

'ukkalā':['A district (janapada) in the region identified with modern Orissa (CAG., p.733). The merchants Tapassu and Bhalluka were on the way from Ukkalā, when a certain deva, an erstwhile relative of theirs, advised them to visit the Buddha at Rājāyatanamūla, near Uruvelā, and to offer food to him, which they did (Vin.i.4). They were on the way to Majjhimadesa (J.i.80). According to the Theragāthā Commentary (i.48f) there were caravan drivers of a city called Pokkharavatī (probably a town in Ukkalā). Their destiṇation was evidently Rājagaha, for we find them visiting the Buddha there after the first sermon and hearing him preach.<br>The men of Ukkalā, together with those of Vassa and Bhañña, are represented as being deniers of cause and effect, deniers of reality (ahetuvādā, akiriyavādā, natthikavādā). (A.ii.31; S.iii.72; M.iii.78; Kvu.60; AA.ii.497; see also KS.iii.63, and GS.ii.34, n.3).<br>The Mahāvastu (iii.303) places Ukkalā in the Uttarāpatha and mentions Adhisthāna as the place from which Tapussa and Bhalluka hailed.<br>The Mahābhārata (E.g., in Bhīsmapārvan ix.365; Drona iv.122) mentions the Ukkalas several times in lists of tribes (va. Okkalā).'],
'ukkaṭṭhā':['A town in Kosala, near the Himālaya. It has been given, free from all taxes (as brahmadeyya), toPokkharasātī by the king of Kosala, in recognition of the former’s skill. It was thickly populated and had much grassland, woodland and corn (D.i.87; DA.i.245). TheIcchānaṅgala wood was in the neighbourhood, and when the Buddha was staying in the wood Pokkharasātī first sent his pupil Ambattha and then went himself to visit the Buddha (see the Ambattha Sutta).<br>There was a road which connected Ukkatthā with Setavyā (A.ii.37) and with Vesāli (J.ii.259). Chatta goes from Setavyā to Ukkatthā to learn under Pokkharasātī (VvA.229).<br>It was in the Subhagavana at Ukkatthā that the Mūlapariyāya Sutta (M.i.1ff) was preached and the Mūlapariyāya Jātaka (J.ii.259ff) was related in connection with it. Ukkatthā was the residence ofAnganika-Bhāradvāja (ThagA.339).<br>Buddhaghosa explains (MA.i.9; AA.ii.504) that the city was so called because it was built by the light of torches (ukkā) at night, in order that it might be completed within the auspicious time.<br>In the Brahmanimantika Sutta (M.i.326; but see S.i.142; J.iii.359), the Buddha says that it was while he was residing at Subhagavana that be became aware of the erroneous views ofBaka-brahma and went to the Brahma-world to teach Baka the truth.<br>The Divyāvadāna calls the city Ukkatā (p.621).'],
'ukkācelā':['A village in the Vajji country, on the banks of the Ganges, on the road from Rājagaha toVesāli and near the latter (UdA.322).<br>Once while Sāriputta was staying there, the ParibbājakaSāmandaka visited him and talked to him about Nibbāna (S.iv.261-2). Some time later, after the death of Sāriputta and Moggallāna within a fortnight of each other, the Buddha came to Ukkacelā on his way to Vesāli and at a gathering of the monks uttered high praise of the two chief disciples and spoke of the loss the Order had sustained by their death (S.v.163f).<br>The Cūlagopālaka Sutta was also preached at Ukkacelā (M.i.225).<br>Buddhaghosa says (MA.i.447) that when the city was being built, on the day its site was marked out, fish came ashore at night from the river, and men, noticing them, made torches (ukkā) out of rags (celā), dipped them in oil, and by their light caught the fish. On account of this incident the city was called Ukkācelā (v.l. Ukkacelā, Ukkāvelā).'],
'ukkāsatika thera':['An arahant. Ninety-four kappas ago he had seen the Pacceka Buddha Kosika, in Himavā, engaged in meditation, and for seven days he had one hundred torches kept lighted near the Buddha.

'ukkhepakata':['He was the son of a brahmin of the Vaccha family. Having heard the Buddha preach, he entered the Order and dwelt in a village settlement in Kosala. He learnt the doctrine from the various monks who came there from time to time, but it was not until he learnt from Sāriputta that he was able to distinguish between Sutta, Vinaya and Abhidhamma. He thus became versed in the Three Pitakas even before the First Council (On this see Brethren, p.66. n.1). He practised meditation and soon attained arahantship (Thag.v.65; ThagA.i.147f). Later he became a teacher of the doctrine. According to Dhammapāla (ThagA.i.149), the soubriquet Ukkhepakata was given to him because he was able to teach and recite passages from the three Pitakas ”casting them in their proper setting, according as they belonged to each Pitaka.” The title was meant to emphasise his eminent repertory of orally-learnt doctrine.<br>He had been a householder in the time of the Buddha Siddhattha and had helped a guild who built a hall for the Buddha by giving them a pillar for the building.<br>Fifty-five kappas ago he was a king named Yasodhara and twenty-one kappas ago another king named Udena.

'uḷāra':['The daughter of a family in Rājagaha, which waited upon Mahā Moggallāna; was very generous and always gave away in alms the half of anything which she possessed. She was given in marriage to the son of a family of unbelievers. One day, seeing Moggallāna begging for alms, she invited him and gave him some cakes which had been put away by her mother-in-law.

Earlier in the day, when Abhaya Thera, having finished a portion of the sermon, was about to take some refreshment, she censured him, saying that he should have refreshed himself earlier.

They returned and told the king that she was a witch, and she was, therefore, given in marriage toAhipāraka, son of the commander-in-chief. Ummadantī bore the king a grudge for having refused her hand, and one feast day, when the king passed under her window, she threw flowers at him to attract his attention. From the moment that the king saw Ummadantī, he was beside himself with longing for her and lay on his couch raving about her. When Ahipāraka heard what had happened he offered his wife to the king, but Sivi was too righteous to hear of accepting the gift, and by a supreme effort of will he overcame his infatuation.<br>In a former birth Ummadantī was born in a poor family of Benares, and on a certain festal day having seen some holy women clad in robes dyed scarlet with safflower she asked her parents for a similar robe. Realising that they were too poor to afford the gift, she worked for a long time for another family, and they finally gave her a robe. When she was about to don it, after a bath in the river, she saw a disciple of Kassapa Buddha standing without any proper clothes, his robes having been stolen from the river bank. She first gave him half her garment, then, seeing how radiant he looked in it, she gave him also the other half and uttered a prayer that in a further existence she should surpass all other women in looks and be of maddening beauty.<br>She is identified with the Therī Uppalavannā.

At the end of the rains a young goose, who had been given two portions of food to make him strong would break the web and the geese would fly away. Once the rains lasted five months and the geese, having no food, were forced to eat their eggs and then their young.

'unnābha':['A brahmin. He once visited the Buddha atSāvatthi and asked him whether the five sense-faculties (indriyāni), which were of different scope and range, had any common ground of resort (pati-sarāna).

'upaka':['1. Upaka<br>An ājivaka whom the Buddha met on his way between Gayā and the Bodhi Tree, after he set out from Isipatana for the preaching of the First Sermon. Upaka questioned the Buddha on his attainments, and when the Buddha told him what he had accomplished he asked the Buddha if he were ”Anantajina.” When the Buddha acknowledged it, Upaka shook his bead saying, ”It may be so, friend,” and went along by another road (J.i.81; Vin.i.8; M.i.170-1; DhA.iv.71-2). It is said (DA.ii.471) that the Buddha walked all the way from the Bodhi Tree to Isipatana - instead of flying through the air, as is the custom of Buddhas - because he wished to meet Upaka.<br>After this meeting Upaka went to the Vankahāra country and there, having fallen desperately in love with Cāpā, the daughter of a huntsman who looked after him, starved for seven days and in the end persuaded the huntsman to give her to him in marriage. For a living, Upaka hawked about the flesh brought by the huntsman. In due course Cāpā bore him a son, Subhadda. When the baby cried, Cāpā sang to him saying, ”Upaka’s son, ascetic’s son, game-dealer’s boy, don’t cry,” thus mocking her husband. In exasperation he told her of his friend Anantajina, but she did not stop teasing him. One day, in spite of her attempts to keep him, he left her and went to the Buddha at Sāvatthi. The Buddha, seeing him coming, gave orders that anyone asking for Anantajina should be brought to him. Having learnt from Upaka his story, the Buddha had him admitted to the Order. As a result of his meditation, Upaka became an anāgāmī and was reborn in the Avihā heaven (ThigA.220ff; MA.i.388f. Upaka’s story is also given in SnA.i.258ff, with several variations in detail). The Samyutta Nikāya (i.35, 60) records a visit paid to the Buddha by Upaka and six other beings born in Avihā. According to the Majjhima Commentary (i.389), Upaka became an arahant as soon as he was born in Avihā.<br>In the Therīgāthā he is also called Kāla (v.309. This may have been a term of affection used because of his dark colour) and his birth-place is given as Nāla, a village near the Bodhi Tree, where he is said to have been living with his wife at the time he left her (ThigA.225).<br>Later, Cāpā, too, left the world and became an arahant Therī.<br>The Divyāvadana (p.393) calls Upaka Upagana.<br>The enumeration of the Buddha’s virtues which was made to Upaka is not regarded as a real dhammadesanā because it took place before the preaching of the first sermon. It produced only a vāsanā-bhāgiya result, not sekha- or ribaddha-bhāgiya (UdA.54).<br>The words of the Buddha’s speech to Upaka are often quoted (E.g., Kvu.289).<br>2. Upaka Mandikāputta.-He once visited the Buddha at Gijjhakūta and stated before him his view that whoever starts abusive talk of another, without being able to make good his case, is blameworthy. The Buddha agrees and says that Upaka himself has been guilty of this offence. The Commentary (AA.ii.554) explains that Upaka was a supporter of Devadatta. Upaka protests against being caught in a big noose of words, like a fish caught as soon as he pops up his head. The Buddha explains that it is necessary for him to teach with endless variations of words and similes. Upaka is pleased with the Buddha’s talk and reports the conversation to Ajātasattu. The king shows his anger at the man’s presumption in having remonstrated with the Buddha (A.ii.181f), and the Commentary adds that he had him seized by the neck and cast out.<br>Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.554-5) that Upaka went to visit the Buddha in order to find out whether the Buddha would blame him for being a supporter of Devadatta. According to others, he came to abuse the Buddha because he had heard that the Buddha had consigned Devadatta to hell. He was apparently of low caste, and Ajātasattu addresses him as ”salt-worker’s boy” (lonakārakadāraka) (A.ii.182).'],

He was of very kindly disposition and lived a simple life, eating of the food served in the Mahāpāli alms-hall. It is said that once, when the roof of his palace started leaking at night, he lay all night in the wet, being loth to disturb any of the servants. During a period of drought and famine, he organised a religious festival, causing rain to fall. He built the Rajuppala, Gijjhakūta, Pokkharapāsaya, Valāhassa, Ambutthi and Gondigāma tanks and the Khandarāja Vihāra, besides hospitals and almshouses for women in travail, the blind and the sick.

It was here, too, that the Buddha asked the monks if they had any doubts they wished to hear solved regarding the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, magga and patipadā, or any questions they wished to ask (A.ii.79), and here he gave his last admonition to the monks (S.i.157; see also Ud.37f). Ananda tried to persuade him to die in a place of greater importance, and the Buddha, in order to disabuse his mind, preached to him the Mahā Sudassana Sutta (D.ii.169f).<br>Buddhaghosa says (DA.ii.572f) that the road to the sāla-grove from the Hiraññavatī led from the further bank of the river, like the road from the Kadambanadī to the Thūpārāma in Anurādhapura which led through the Rājamātu-vihāra.

Once when the Buddha was attacked by cramp, Upavāna, with the help of his lay-friend Devahita, obtained hot water and suitable medicines, with which the ailment was healed; the Buddha, thereupon, expressed his gratitude. ThagA.i.308ff; this ailment does not seem to be mentioned in Milinda 134f. where several others are given. This incident is given at greater length in S.i.174f; see also DhA.iv.232f.<br>When the Buddha lay on his death-bed at Kusināra, Upavāna was by his side fanning him; the Buddha, seeing that he obstructed the vision of the devas who had come to pay their last homage to the Teacher, asked Upavāna to move away (D.ii.138f).<br>Two occasions are mentioned on which Upavāna consulted the Buddha on matters of doctrine, once regarding the arising of suffering (S.ii.41-2) and once on the immediate and practical use of the Dhamma (sanditthikadhamma) (S.iv.41). There is also recorded a visit of Upavāna to Sāriputta when they were both staying in the Ghositārāma at Kosambī. Sāriputta asks him about the bojjhaṅgas as being conducive to a happy life and Upavāna explains (S.v.76). On another occasion Upavāna is the enquirer, and he asks Sāriputta about the ”end-maker” (antakara); Sāriputta explains that the ”end-maker” is the one who knows and sees things as they really are (A.ii.163).<br>When an unpleasant interview took place between Sāriputta and Lāludāyī (q.v.) and no one was found to support Sāriputta, the matter is reported to the Buddha, who declares that Ananda should have taken Sāriputta’s side. Soon afterwards Ananda seeks Upavāna and tells him that he was too timid to interfere, and if the Buddha referred to the matter again, would Upavāna undertake to answer? In the evening the Buddha engages Upavāna in conversation and asks him to explain the five qualities which make a monk esteemed and loved by his colleagues. At the end of the discourse the Buddha applauds Upavāna (A.iii.195f).<br>In Padumuttara’s time Upavāna had been a poor man. Seeing people making great offerings at the Buddha’s Thūpa, he was much touched, and having washed his upper garment, he hung it as a flag over the Thūpa.

Upāli Sutta.-Upāli Thera visits the Buddha and asks him for what purpose the various precepts have been laid down for disciples and why the pātimokkha has been recited? For ten purposes, says the Buddha, and proceeds to enumerate them. Similarly, ten reasons are given which justify the suspension of the pātimokkha. A.v.70f.<br>3. Upāli Sutta.-Upāli (1) visits the Buddha and expresses a desire to retire to the solitude of the forest. Such a step is not desirable for those who have not attained to tranquillity of mind, says the Buddha, and explains his meaning by various similes. A full-grown elephant could disport himself in a deep lake according to his fancy, not so a hare or a cat. The sutta goes on to describe how, as a result of the arising of a Tathāgata in the world, a householder would listen to the Dhamma, renounce the world, give up all evil practices and gradually attain to full development of the four jhānas. Upāli is advised to live among the monks and not go into the forest. A.v.201ff.<br>Upāli Vagga.-The fourth chapter of the Dasaka Nipāta of the Anguttara Nikāya.

If a Chaddanta elephant comes to a cakkavatti, it is the youngest of the tribe that comes, if an Uposatha elephant, then it will be the foremost (DA.ii.624; J.iv.232, 234; KhA.172). When the cakkavatti dies, the elephant goes back to his fellows (DA.ii.635). The strength of an Uposatha elephant is equal to that of one thousand million men (BuA.37). In the Milindapañha (p.282), the king of the Uposatha elephants is described as being gentle and handsome, eight cubits in height and nine in girth and length, chewing signs of rut in three places on his body, all white, sevenfold-firm.

The eldest of the ninety nine brothers of Samvara, king of Benares. When Samvara ascended the throne, his brothers protested and laid siege to his city; but Uposatha, having discovered by means of questions put to Samvara, that he was in character by far the best suited for kingship, persuaded the others to renounce their claims to the throne.

When sixteen years old she heard Kassapa Buddha preach, and became a sotāpanna. That same day she attained arahantship, entered the Order and passed into Nibbāna (J.vi.481).<br>In the time of Vipassī, both Uracchadā and Queen Māyā (mother of Gotama Buddha) were born as the daughters of King Bandhumā.

The two girls, wishing to present their gifts to the Buddha, obtained the king’s consent. The elder princess powdered the sandalwood and filled a golden box with it. The younger had the wreath made into a necklet and placed it in a golden casket. They then went to the Buddha, and the elder reverently sprinkled his body with sandalwood and scattered it in his cell with the prayer, ”May I, in time to come, be the mother of a Buddha like you.” The younger reverently placed the necklet on the Buddha and prayed, ”Until I attain arahantship, may this ornament never part from my body.” (J.vi.481)<br>According to the Vimānavatthu Commentary (pp. 270f), Uracchadā’s name was Uracchadamālā and her teacher was a brahmin named Gopāla, who was also present when the Buddha preached to Uracchadamālā.

A Nāga in the crowd, not noticing that the person beside him was a Garuda, laid a hand on his shoulder; discovering his mistake, he was frightened to death and ran away, pursued by the Garuda. The Nāga, coming to a river, where an ascetic, who was the Bodhisatta, was bathing, took refuge in the ascetic’s bark-garment. The Garuda, though able to see the Nāga, would not attack him out of respect for the ascetic. The latter took both of them to his hermitage and made them friendly towards each other by preaching the blessings of loving-kindness.<br>The story was related in reference to two soldiers who were in the habit of quarrelling whenever they met. Not even the king could reconcile them. The Buddha visited them at their homes and, having made them both sotāpannas, took them to see each other. Thenceforth they were great friends, and people marvelled at the Buddha’s power (J.ii.12-14). The Nakula Jātaka was also preached in this connection.<br>2. Uraga Jātaka (No. 354).-The Bodhisatta was once a brahmin in Benares. His household consisted of himself, his wife, a son, a daughter, a daughter-in-law and a female slave. They lived happily together, and on the Bodhisatta’s advice kept their thoughts constantly fixed on the inevitableness of death. One day, while burning some rubbish in the field, the son was bitten by a snake and died. The father laid his body under a tree, and having sent word to his house that all the others should come with perfumes and flowers, when bringing his meal, be went on with his work. After the meal they made a funeral pyre and burnt the body, but not one of them wept a single tear. By virtue of their piety, Sakka’s throne was heated and he appeared to them in disguise. He questioned them separately as to whether their lack of any show of grief for the dead meant that they did not love him. Being convinced that their composure was due to their practice of the thought of death, he revealed his identity, and filled their house with the seven kinds of treasures. The story was related to a landowner of Sāvatthi who, when his son died, gave himself up to despair.

The first stanza of the sutta was preached to the devatā. The Sutta-Nipāta Commentary (SnA.i.15ff) gives the occasions on which the other stanzas were preached. Buddhaghosa says (Sp.iv.761) that the devatā mentioned above took up her residence in Jetavana, on a spot indicated to her by the Buddha, and had, therefore, the privilege of listening to the Buddha’s sermons at close quarters, even when there were great assemblies of the devas present and less powerful devas, like herself, had generally to yield place to the more powerful.

'uttara':['Another name for the Abhayagiri-Vihāra (q.v.). The inhabitants of the Uttaravihāra seem to have kept a chronicle, in the same way as did the dwellers of the Mahā-Vihāra. This is often referred to in the Mahāvamsa Tīkā, as the Uttara-Vihāra-aṭṭhakathā and the Uttara-Vihāra-Mahāvamsa. Judging from the quotations from this work given in the Mahāvamsa Tīkā, the Uttara-Vihāra chronicle seems to have differed from the tradition of the Mahā-Vihāra more in detail than in general construction. It is not possible to say whether it contained exegetical matter on the Pāli Canon besides matters of historical interest. For a detailed account of the work see Geiger: The Dīpavamsa and the Mahāvamsa, pp.50ff; also my edition of the Mahāvamsa Tīkā.'],
'uttara sutta':['1. Uttara Sutta.-The conversation between Uttara devaputta (Uttara 3) and the Buddha. One’s life is short, says the devaputta; one should, therefore, gather merit, in order to gain bliss. Rather, answers the Buddha, reject the bait of all the worlds and aspire after final Peace (S.i.54).<br>2. Uttara Sutta.-Preached to the monks by Uttara Thera (Uttara 6) at Mount Sankheyya at Dhavajālikā in Mahisavatthu. From time to time we should reflect on our own misfortunes as well as on those of others, and likewise on our successes. Vessavana heard this sutta being preached as he was journeying from north to south on some business. He went to Tāvatimsa, where he informed Sakka of what he had heard Uttara say. Sakka, thereupon, appeared before Uttara and asked him whether his sermon was based on his own illumination (patibhāna), or on what he had heard from the Buddha. Uttara’s reply was that his words were garnered from the Doctrine of the Buddha just as a man takes a handful of grain from a heap of grain. Sakka then repeated the whole sermon on the same subject, which be had heard the Buddha preach to the monks at Gijjhakūta in Rājagaha. A.iv.162-6.'],
'uttara-rāja-putta':['Mentioned in the Samantapāsādikā (Sp.iii.544) as having sent to the Elder Mahāpaduma a shrine made of gold, which the Elder refused to accept, as it was not permissible for him to do so.'],
'uttaradesa':['A province of Ceylon, probably to the north of Anurādhapura. It was often occupied by the Tamils, and its chiefs refused to acknowledge allegiance to the Sinhalese kings. Its people had to be subdued from time to time by the Sinhalese kings, in order to establish the peace of the land and the security of the throne (See, e.g., Cv.xliv.71; xlvii.3, 54; xlviii.83-4, 95, 112).<br>The district formed a convenient landing-place for invaders coming to Ceylon from India, where they might complete their preparations (E.g., Cv.i.14). It is sometimes called Uttararattha, E.g., Cv.ixx.92.'],
'uttaragāma':['A village in Ceylon, the residence of Pingala-Buddharakkhita Thera. There were one hundred families living there and the Elder had, at some time or other, entered into samāpatti at the door of each of their houses, while waiting for alms. MA.ii.978.'],

'uttaramātā':['1. Uttaramātā.-Mother of Uttara, who was a son of Udena’s minister. (See Uttara 7.) She was miserly, and when her son gave alms she abused him, and spoke disparagingly of the holy men who accepted his gifts. On one occasion, however, she approved of a gift of a tuft of peacock’s feathers at the festival of dedication of a vihāra. After death she was born as a peta. Because of her approval of the gift of peacock’s feathers she had lovely hair, but when she stepped into the river to drink water, all the water turned into blood. (She had told her son that his gifts would turn into blood in his nest birth). For fifty-five years she wandered, famished and thirsty, till one day, seeing the Elder Kankhā-Revata spending the day on the banks of the Ganges, she approached him, covering her nudity with her hair, and begged him for a drink. The Elder, having learnt from her her story, gave food and drink and clothes to the monks on her behalf and she obtained release from her suffering and enjoyed great bliss (Pv.28f; PvA.140ff).<br>According to the Visuddhi-Magga (ii.382), Uttaramātā was able to go through the sky because of the psychic power inborn in her as a result of Kamma. This probably refers to another woman. (See below 2.)<br>2. Uttaramātā.-A Yakkhinī, mother of Punabbasu and Uttarā. Once as she passed Jetavana at sunset looking for food, with her daughter on her hip and holding her son by his finger, she saw the assembly, intently listening to the Buddha’s sermon. She, too, hoping to get some benefit, listened quietly and with great earnestness, hushing her children to quietness. The Buddha preached in such a manner that both she and her son could understand, and at the end of the sermon they both became Sotāpannā. She immediately got rid of her sad Yakkha-state and obtained heavenly bliss, and took up her residence in a tree near the Buddha’s Fragrant Chamber.<br>Little Uttarā was too young to realise the Truth.

'uttaramūla nikāya':['One of the fraternities of monks in Ceylon, an off-shoot of the Abhayagiri sect. Their headquarters were probably at the Uttarola Vihāra, built by King Mānavamma, and given to the monks of the Abhayagiri Vihāra, for having consented to take into the Order his elder brother, in spite of the fact that he had lost one eye as the result of some yoga practices.<br>The first chief of Uttarola was the king’s brother himself and he was in charge of six hundred monks. He was granted great honours and privileges together with five classes of servants to minister to him. He was also appointed to supervise the guardians of the Tooth Relic (Cv.lvii.7-11, and 16-26; also Geiger’s Trs.i.194, n.2 and 3).<br>From a Tamil inscription of Mānavamma we find that he kept up his patronage of the Uttaramūla Nikāya, and it is recorded that he gave over the custodianship of the Tooth Relic to a monk of this fraternity, named Moggallāna (Epi. Zey., vol.ii., pt. vi., pp.250ff).<br>Anuruddha, author of the Anuruddha Sataka and the Abhidhammattha-Saṅgaha, describes himself in the colophon to the former work as an ”Upasthavira” of the Uttaramūla Nikāya.<br>In later years this Nikāya produced many an illustrious star in Celyon’s literary firmament, among them the grammarian Moggallāna, Vilgammūla, Mahā Thera and Sri Rāhula.

'uttarapañcāla':['A city. When Apacara (Upacara), king of Ceti, was swallowed up by the fires of Avīci, because of his falsehood, his five sons came to the brahmin Kapila and sought his protection. He advised them to build new cities. The city built by the fourth son was called Uttarapañcāla. It was founded in the north of Ceti, on the spot where the prince saw a wheel-frame (cakkapañjara) entirely made of jewels (J.iii.461).<br>According to the scholiast to the Kāmanīta Jātaka (J.ii.214), however, and also according to theKumbhakāra Jātaka (J.iii.379ff), Pañcāla or Uttarapañcāla is the name of a country (rattha) whose capital was Kampilla, while in the Brahmadatta Jātaka (iii.79) also in the scholiast of the Citta-Sambhūta Jātaka (iv.396), Uttarapañcāla is given as the name of the city and Kampilla as that of the country and we are told that a king Pañcāla reigned there.<br>Pañcāla was also the name of the king of Uttarapañcāla in the Sattigumba Jātaka (iv.430), theJayaddisa Jātaka (v.21), and the Gandatindu Jātaka (v.98).

'uttarāpatha':['The northern division of Jambudīpa. Its boundaries are nowhere explicitly stated in Pāli literature. It has been suggested (See Law, Early Geog. of Bsm., pp.48ff) that Uttarāpatha was originally the name of a great trade-route, the northern high road which extended from Sāvatthi toTakkasilā in Gandhāra, and that it lent its name - as did theDakkhināpatha - to the region through which it passed. If this be so, the name would include practically the whole of Northern India, from Anga in the east to Gandhāra in the north-west, and from the Himālaya in the north to the Vindhyā in the south.<br>According to the brahmanical tradition, as recorded in the Kāvyamīmāmsā (p.93), the Uttarāpatha is to the west of Prithudaka (Pehoa, about fourteen miles west of Thāneswar).<br>The chief divisions included in this territory are mentioned in the Pāli literature as Kasmīra-Gandhāra andKamboja.

'vacchagotta':['1. Vacchagotta. A Paribbājaka, who later became an arahant Thera. Several conversations he had with the Buddha are mentioned in the books. For details see the Tevijja Vacchagotta-, Aggi Vacchagotta-, Mahā Vacchagotta-, Vaccha- and Vacchagotta-Suttas. Some of these suttas are quoted in the Kathāvatthu (E.g., p. 267, 505). The Samyutta Nikāya contains a whole section on Vacchagotta; his discussions were chiefly concerned with such mythical questions as to whether the world is eternal, the nature of life, the existence or otherwise of the Tathāgata after death, etc. S.iii.257ff.; see also S.iv.391ff., for several discussions of Vacchagotta with Moggallāna, Ananda and Sabhiya Kaccāna on similar topics. The three Vacchagotta Suttas of the Majjhima Nikāya seem to contain the story of Vacchagotta’s conversion, in due order: at the conclusion of the Tevijja Vacchagotta (No. 72) it is merely stated that ”the Paribbājaka Vacchagotta rejoiced in what the Blessed One has said.” At the end of the next, the Aggi Vacchagotta, he is mentioned as having accepted the Buddha as his teacher. In the third, the Mahā Vacchagotta, he seeks ordination from the Buddha at Rājagaha, and receives it after the requisite probationary period of four months. He returns to the Buddha after two weeks and tells him that he has attained all that is to be attained by a non arahant’s understanding and asks for a further exposition of the Doctrine. The Buddha tells him to proceed to the study of calm and insight, whereby sixfold abhiññā may be acquired. Vacchagotta profits by the lesson and soon after becomes an arahant. He thereupon sends news of his attainment to the Buddha through some monks, and the Buddha says he has already heard the news from the devas (M.i.493 97).<br>This story definitely identifies the Paribbājaka with the Thera of the same name, whose verse of ecstasy is included in the Theragāthā (vs. 112). According to the Commentary (ThagA.i.221), he belonged to a rich brahmin family of the Vaccha clan (Vacchagotta). His personal name is not given. He became an expert in brahmin learning, but failing to find therein what he sought, he became a Paribbājaka, joining the Buddha’s Order later.<br>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder of Bandhumatī, and one day, when the Buddha and his monks were invited to the king’s palace, he swept the street along which the Buddha passed and set up a Rag as decoration. As a result he was born, four kappas ago, as a rājā, Sudhaja by name. He is probably identical with Vīthisammajjaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.177.<br>2. Vacchagotta. A Paribbājaka. He is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikāva (A.i.180f ) as visiting the Buddha at Venāgapura, where he was at the head of the brahmins. He is possibly to be identified with Vacchagotta (1). In this context, however, he is called Venāgapurika. Vacchagotta (1) (q.v.) was a native of Rājagaha, but seems to have travelled widely, for we find him visiting the Buddha at Vesāli (M.i.481), at Sāvatthi (M.i.483; S.iii.257), and at Ñātikā (S.iv. 401), in addition to his visits to Rājagaha (M.i.489). The Commentary (AA.i.410), moreover, explains Venāgapuraka by ”Venāgapuravāsī,” which may mean that he merely lived at Venāgapura and was not necessarily a native of that place. Vacchagotta’s question was as to how the Buddha looked so shining and his colour so clear? Was it because he slept on a luxurious bed? The Buddha answered that his bed was luxurious and comfortable, but from quite a different point of view. At the end of the discourse, Vacchagotta declares himself a follower of the Buddha.<br>3.

'vaddhakisūkara jātaka':['A carpenter of a village near Benares was once wandering in the forest, and having found a young boar in a pit, took him home and brought him up. The boar was well mannered and helped the carpenter in his work, and so he came to be called Vaddhakisūkara (”Carpenter boar”). When he grew up, the carpenter took him back to the forest, and there he came across some boars who lived in mortal fear of a tiger. The young boar drilled his army of boars, arranged them in battle array, and awaited the tiger. When he arrived, the boars, under their leader’s instructions, mimicked the tiger in all he did. The tiger, thereupon, sought the advice of a false ascetic who shared his prey, and, following his counsel, made a leap at the boar leader and fell into a pit which had been dug for him. There the boars attacked him and ate him, and those who were unable to get any of the flesh sniffed at the others’ mouths to see how ”tiger” tasted. Then they set off after the false ascetic, and when he climbed a fig tree they dug it up and it fell to the ground. The man was torn to pieces and his body licked clean. The boars then placed their leader on the tree trunk, consecrated him king with water, which they fetched in the dead man’s skull, and made a young sow his consort. (This is how kings came to be consecrated with water from shells and seated on a throne of fig planks.) The Bodhisatta who was then a tree sprite sang the boar’s praises.<br>The story was told in reference to Dhanuggahatissa (q.v.), who was responsible for Pasenadi’s victory over Ajātasattu.

He belonged to the family of a minister of Vesāli, and, seeing the majesty of the Buddha who visited the city, he joined the Order and lived in a wood near by. A festival took place in Vesāli, with much singing and dancing and gaiety. This distracted Vajjiputta, and he expressed his disgust in a verse spoken in scorn of the forest life. A woodland sprite heard him and upbraided him, saying, ”Though you spurn life in the forest, the wise, desiring solitude, think much of it,” and she then uttered a verse praising it.

There he is called a rājā, and is said to have renounced his kingdom when his turn came to rule. On the day of the festival, on the full moon day of Kattika, he was filled with discontent. After his conversation with the woodland sprite, he sought the Buddha, who preached to him. He attained arahantship at the end of the Buddha’s sermon. DhA.iii.460f.; see also SA.i.228, where also he is called rājā. There may be some confusion between Vajjiputta (1) and (2).<br>He is evidently to be identified with Renupūjaka of the Apadāna. Ap.i.146.<br>2. Vajjiputta Thera. He belonged to a Licchavi rājā’s family, and while still young, and learning various arts, such as training elephants, he was filled with the desire for reṇunciation. One day he went to a vihāra where the Buddha was preaching, entered the Order, and not long after became an arahant.<br>After the Buddha’s death, when the chief Elders were living in various places prior to their agreed meeting for the recital of the Dhamma, he saw Ananda, still a learner (sekha), teaching the Doctrine to a large assembly. Wishing to urge him to higher attainment, Vajjiputta uttered a verse, and this verse was among those which led to Ananda’s attainment of arahantship. The verse is found in Thag.vs.119. In S.i.199 the verse is attributed to a forest deva who wished to agitate Ananda. In Rockhill (op. cit., 155f.), Vajjiputta was Ananda’s attendant at the time and preached to the people while Ananda meditated.<br>Ninety four kappas ago, Vajjiputta had seen a Pacceka Buddha begging for alms and had given him plantain fruits.

'vajjiputtaka sutta':['A Vajjian monk visits the Buddha at the Kūtāgārasālā in Vesāli, and complains that he has to recite over two hundred and fifty rules twice a month. ”I cannot stand such training,” he says.

The monk agrees to do this and is told to develop higher morality, the higher thought and higher insight (adhisīla, adhicitta, adhipaññā). The monk develops these, and, as a result, gets rid of lust, malice, and delusion. A.i.230f.'],
'vajjiputtakā':['The name of a large group of monks belonging to the Vajjian clan and dwelling in Vesāli, who, one century after the Buddha’s death, brought forward Ten Points (dasa vatthūni) as being permissible for members of the Order. These points are as follows:<br>(1) The storing of salt in a horn (singilonakappa); (2) the eating of food when the shadow of the sun had passed two fingers’ breadth beyond noon (duvangulakappa); (3) to eat once and then go again to the village for alms (gāmantārakappa); (4) the holding of the uposatha separately by monks dwelling in the same district (āvāsakappa); (5) the carrying out of an official act when the assembly is incomplete (anumatikappa); (6) the following of a practice because it is so done by one’s tutor or teacher (ācinnakappa); (7) the eating of sour milk by one who has already had his midday meal (amathitakappa); (8) the use of strong drink before it has fermented (jalogikappa); (9) the use of a rug which is not of the proper size (nisīdanakappa); (10) the use of gold and silver (jātarūparajatakappa). The orthodox monks refused to agree to these points, and one of their leaders, Yasa Kākaṇḍakaputta, publicly condemned the action of the Vajjiputtakas. Yasa then left Kosambī, and, having summoned monks fromPāvā in the west and Avanti in the south, sought Sambhūta Sānavāsi in Ahogaṅga. On his advice they sought Soreyya-Revata, and together they consulted Sabbakāmi at Vālikārāma. In the Council that followed the Ten Points were declared invalid, and this decision was conveyed to the monks. Soon after was held a recital of the Doctrine in which seven hundred monks took part under the leadership of Soreyya-Revata. The recital lasted eight months.<br>The story of the Vajjiputtaka heresy is given in the twelfth chapter of the Cullavagga (Vin.ii.294ff.); the Mhv.iv.9ff. gives more details in certain respects; see also Dpv.iv.48ff.; v.17ff.; 32ff.<br>It is noteworthy that even during the Buddha’s life five hundred monks, described as Vajjiputtakā, seceded from the Order and joined Devadatta though they were later brought back by Sāriputta and Moggallāna (Vin.ii.199f.). Buddhaghosa actually (Sp.i.228) identifies the heretics as belonging to the same party. For the part played by Yasa Thera see Yasa (2).<br>The Vajjiputtakas refused to accept the finding of Revata’s Council and formed a separate sect, the Mahāsanghikas, numbering ten thousand monks, who held a recital of their own.'],
'vajjirājā':['See Vajjī.'],
'vajjita thera':['He belonged to a retainer’s (ibbha) family in Kosala, and, because he had come from the Brahma world, he wept whenever a woman took him in her arms.

'vajjiyamāhita':['A householder of Campā, a devout and skilled follower of the Buddha.<br>Once, when on his way to see the Buddha at Gaggarā Lake, he found he had arrived too early and went into the Paribbājakārāma near by. The Paribbājakas asked him if it was true that the Buddha ridicules all forms of asceticism and austerity. They spoke of the Buddha as a teacher of a discipline which he himself did not follow, a nihilist (venayika) and a visionary (? appaññattika). (For explanation of these terms, see AA.ii.854).<br>Vajjiyamāhita refuted their arguments, maintaining that the Buddha declared what was good and what was bad, and that the truth of his teachings could be proved. Having thus silenced them, he sought the Buddha, to whom he repeated the conversation. The Buddha praised him, and said it was untrue that he discouraged all austerity and asceticism; such penances as led to the destruction of evil states and the promotion of good states, he welcomed and encouraged. When Vajjiyamāhita had left him, the Buddha held him up to the monks as an example of a good householder, capable of profitable discussion with followers of other persuasions.<br>A.v.189ff.; see also A.iii.451.'],
'vajjī':['The name of a country and of its people. It was one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas. The inhabitants appear to have consisted of several confederate clans of whom the Licchavī and theVidehā were the chief.<br>A passage in the Commentaries (e.g., DA.ii.519) - which states that among those responsible for the administration of justice in the Vajji country (see Licchavī) were the Atthakulakā - has given rise to the conjecture that Atthakulakā meant heads of eight clans composing the Vajjian confederacy. There is no other evidence regarding the number of the clans. The Atthakulakā were probably a judicial committee.<br>As time went on the Licchavī became the most powerful of these clans (Licchavī Vajjiratthavāsīhi pasatthā) (E.g., MA.i.394), and the names Vajjī and Licchavī were often synonymous. See Licchavī; in the Trikandasesa, quoted by Cunningham (AGI. 509), Licchavi, Vaideha and Tirabhukti were synonymous. In one passage (A.iii.76) the Licchavi, Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is represented as saying, ”These Licchavis will yet become Vajjians” (bhavissanti Yajjī). This probably only means that there was great hope of these young men becoming true Vaijians, practising the seven conditions of welfare taught by the Buddha, conditions which ensured their prosperity. But see G. S.iii.62, n.1 and 3.<br>Vesāli was the capital of the Licchavis andMithilā of the Videhas. In the time of the Buddha, both Vesāli and Mithilā were republics, though Mithilā had earlier been a kingdom under Janaka.<br>In the time of the Buddha, and even up to his death, the Vajjians were a very prosperous and happy community. The Buddha attributed this to the fact that they practiced the seven conditions of welfare taught to them by himself in the Sārandada Cetiya. The details of this teaching, and various other matters connected with the Vajji, are given under Licchavī. But soon after the Buddha’s death, (three years after the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli, according to Buddhaghosa, DA.ii.522) Ajātasattu, with the help of his minister Vassakāra, sowed dissension among the Vajjians and conquered their territory.<br>The Buddha travelled several times through the Vajjian country, the usual route being through Kosala,Malla, Vajji, Kāsi, Magadha, and thus back (See, e.g., S.v.348), and he preached to the people, mostly in theKūtāgārasālā in Vesāli. Among other places besides Vesāli visited by the Buddha, are mentioned Ukkācelā, Kotigāma (see, e.g., J.ii.232, where it is called a village of the Vajjians, on the Ganges), Nādikā (in which were Giñjakāvasatha and Gosingasālavana), Beluvagāma (or Veluvagāma), Bhandagāma, Bhogagāma and Hatthigāma. Pubbavijjhana, the birthplace of Channa, is also mentioned as a village of the Vajjians (S.iv.59). The Vaggumudā river flowed through Vajjian territory (Ud.iii.3).<br>In one context (UdA., p. 382) Dhammapāla describes Udena as Vajjirājā. This is probably a mistake, for nowhere is Udena, who was king of the Vatsas (or Vamsas), called the king of the Vajjis. The Vajjī are mentioned in the Mahānāradakassapa Jātaka. It is significant that the first great schism in the Buddhist Order arose in Vajji, when the Vajjiputtakā brought forward their Ten Points. Even during the Buddha’s lifetime some monks of Vajji joined Devadatta (Vin.ii.199f).<br>According to Hiouen Thsang, (Beal: op. cit., 77) who visited it, the Vajji (Vriji) country was broad from east to west and narrow from north to south. The people of the neighbouring countries were called Samvajji, or United Vajjis. For details see Cunningham, AGI. 512ff.<br>The Commentaries contain a mythical account of the origin of the name Vajjī. See Licchavī.'],
'vaka jātaka':['A wolf once lived on a rock near the Ganges. The winter floods came and surrounded the rock, and the wolf, unable to escape, decided to keep the holy day. The Bodhisatta, who was Sakka, appeared before him in the guise of a he goat, and the wolf, forgetting his holy day, chased him round and round the rock. Finding he could not succeed in catching him, the wolf expressed his joy that his holy day had not been violated! Sakka, hovering above him, rebuked him for his weakness.<br>The story was related in reference to some monks, followers of Upasena (Vaṅgantaputta) (q.v.). Being aware of the permission granted by the Buddha to the monks who practiced the thirteen dhutahgas to visit him even during his periods of solitude, these monks would practice them for a short while and then visit him. But, the visit over, they would at once throw off their rag robes and don other garments. The Buddha discovered this and related the Jātaka. J.ii.449ff.; cp.

Once five hundred merchants were cast ashore there and became the husbands of the yakkhinīs. In the night the yakkhinīs left them and ate their former husbands.

Now it happened that the Bodhisatta was a horse of the Valāhaka race and was flying through the air from the Himālaya to Tambapanni.

He was the son of a Malla chieftain of Pāvā and joined the Order with his companions, Godhika, Subāhu and Uttiya, when they went on some embassy to Kapilavatthu and saw the Yamakapātihāriya in Nigrodhārāma. Bimbisāra later built huts for them, but he forgot to roof them, and so there was no rain till the roofs were added.<br>In the time of Siddhattha Buddha, Valliya offered him a handful of flowers. ThagA.i.123; his verse is included in the Thag. (vs. 53).<br>2. Valliya Thera. He was the son of an eminent brahmin of Sāvatthi, and, owing to his good friends, he met the Buddha and joined the Order, soon after attaining arahantship. Thirty one kappas ago he saw the Pacceka Buddha Nārada at the foot of a tree, and built for him a hut of reeds, which he thatched with grass, together with a cloistered walk strewn with sand. He was seventy one times king of the devas and thirty four times king of men. ThagA.i.247; two verses in the Thag. (125-6) are attributed to him.<br>He is probably identical with Nalāgārika of the Apadāna. Ap.i.278f.<br>3. Valliya Thera. He belonged to a brahmin family of Vesāli, and was named Gandimitta (v.l. Kanhamitta). Much struck by the Buddha when he came to Vesāli, he joined the Order under Mahā Kaccāyana. Because he was dull of insight and depended too much on his colleagues, he was called Valliya (creeper), like the ivy which must lean on something in order to grow. Later, following the advice of Venudatta Thera, he developed insight.<br>In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was a rich brahmin, well versed in learning. Later, he renounced eighty crores of wealth, and, after becoming an ascetic, lived on a river bank. There the Buddha visited him, and, seated on an antelope skin, preached the Doctrine. The ascetic paid him great honour and gave him mangoes and perfume and flowers.<br>In the Apadāna verses, quoted in ThagA., it is said that Valliya was born in the city of Vebhāra, built by Vissakamma, and that he left the household at the age of five. ThagA.i.292f.; two verses addressed by him to Venudatta are included in the Thag. (167-8).<br>He is probably identical with Candanamāliya of the Apadāna. Ap.ii.423f.'],

'vammīka sutta':['A deity appeared before Kumārakassapa in Andhavana and propounded a riddle:<br>”There is an anthill burning day and night. The brahmin said: ’Take your tool, Sumedha (sage), and dig.’ As the brahmin dug, he came across, successively, a bar, a frog, a forked passage, a strainer, a tortoise, a cleaver, a joint of meat - all of which he was told to cast out and dig on. He then came across a cobra, which he was asked not to harm, but to worship.”<br>At the suggestion of the deity, Kassapa related the story to the Buddha, who solved the riddle. The anthill is the body, the brahmin the arahant, the tool wisdom, digging perseverance, the bar ignorance, the forked passage doubting, the strainer the five nīvāraṇas, the tortoise the fivefold upādāna -kkhandhas, the cleaver the fivefold pleasures of sense, the joint of meat passion’s delights (nandīrāga), and the cobra (nāga) the arahant monk (M.i.142ff).<br>According to the Commentary (MA.i.340), Kumārakassapa was not an arahant at the time of the preaching of the sutta. The deity was a deity of the Suddhāvāsa brahma world. He was one of five friends who, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, had entered the Order and who, in order to meditate uninterruptedly, had climbed a rock by means of a ladder which they had then removed, thus cutting off their return. The eldest became an arahant in three days, the second (anuthera) was this deity, who had become an anāgāmī. The third was Pukkusāti, the fourth Bāhiya Dārucīriya and the last Kumārakassapa. This deity was responsible for the arahantship both of Bāhiya and Kassapa, for Kassapa took the Vammīka Sutta as the subject of his meditations and thus developed insight.'],

'vanavaccha thera':['1. Vanavaccha Thera. He was the son of Vacchagotta a brahmin of Kapilavatthu, and was born in the forest, his mother having longed to see it and having been taken in travail while wandering there. His name was Vaccha; but because of his love for the woods, he was called Vanavaccha. He left the world soon after the Buddha’s Renunciation, and led the ascetic life till he heard of the Buddha’s Enlightenment. Then he joined the Order, and it was in the forest that he strove and won arahantship. When he returned to Kapilavatthu with the Buddha, his companions asked him why he so loved the forest, and he spoke a verse in praise of forest life (Thag.13).<br>In the time of Atthadassī Buddha, he was a large tortoise living in the Vinatā. Seeing the Buddha about to cross the river, he took him on his back. Many hundreds of times afterwards he lived as an ascetic in the forest. In the time of Kassapa Buddha he became a dove, and his heart was gladdened by the sight of a monk practicing compassion. Later he was born as a householder in Benares and renounced the world. ThagA.i.58f.; Ap.ii.506f.<br>2. Vanavaccha Thera. The son of a rich brahmin of Rājagaha; he joined the Order, impressed by the majesty of the Buddha’s visit to Bimbisāra. Soon after, he attained arahantship and, devoted to detachment, dwelt in the woods hence his name. When he went to Rājagaha his kinsmen asked him to live near them, but he said he preferred the lonely life of the forest (Thag.113).<br>In the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a labourer, and, having committed a crime, while fleeing from justice he saw a Bodhi tree. Pleased with the look of the tree, he gathered masses of asoka flowers and heaped them up round the tree. When his pursuers reached him, he remained as he was, looking at them, with no hatred in his heart. They hurled him into a precipice, and he died with the thought of the Bodhi tree in his heart.

'vangisa thera':['He belonged to a brahmin family and was proficient in the Vedas. He gained repute by tapping on skulls with his finger nail and telling thereby where the owners of the skull were reborn. During three years he thus gained much money. Then, in spite of the protests of his colleagues, he went to see theBuddha, who gave him the skull of an arahant (according to the Apadāna, he saw Sāriputta first and learnt from him about the Buddha). Vangīsa could make nothing of this and joined the Order to learn its secret. He was ordained byNigrodhakappa, and, meditating on the thirty two constituents of the body, he won arahantship. He then visited the Buddha again and praised him in various verses, full of similes and metaphors. This brought him reputation as a poet (Kāvyacitta or Kāveyyamatta). Later the Buddha declared him foremost among those pre eminent in ready expression (patibhānavantānam). His resolve to attain to this position was made in the time ofPadumuttara Buddha. A.i.24; Dpv.iv.4; ThagA.ii.192ff.; AA.i.149ff.; DhA.iv.226f.; SNA.i.345f.; Ap.ii.495ff.<br>The Theragāthā contains numerous verses spoken by him on various occasions (Thag.1208-79; most of these are repeated at S.i.183ff ) - some of them (1209-18) uttered about himself, his attempts to suppress desires excited by the sight of gaily dressed women (Cf. S.i.185; on one such occasion, he confessed his disaffection to Ananda, who admonished him.); others (1219-22) were self admonitions against conceit because of his facility of speech; some were spoken in praise of sermons preached by the Buddha - e.g., the Subhāsita Sutta (1227-30), a Sutta on Nibbāna (1238-45), and a Sutta preached at the Pavāraṇa ceremony (1231-7). Several verses were in praise of his colleagues - e.g. Sāriputta (1231-3),Aññā Kondañña (1246-8), andMoggallāna (1249-51). One of Vangīsa’s long poems (vvs. 1263-74) is addressed to the Buddha, questioning him as to the destiny of his (Vangīsa’s) teacher Nigrodhakappa. The Commentary (ThagA.ii.211) explains that when Nigrodhakappa died Vangīsa was absent and wished to be assured by the Buddha that his teacher had reached Nibbāna. But the poem is more than a question. It is really a eulogy of the Buddha. Another verse (1252) describes the Buddha as he sat surrounded by his monks on the banks of the Gaggarā at Campā.<br>The Samyutta (S.i.185ff.; SA.i.207ff ) devotes one whole section to Vangīsa, dealing with the incidents connected with his life and giving poems made by him on these occasions. The Milinda (p. 390)’also contains a poem attributed to Vangīsa in praise of the Buddha. According to the Apadāna (Ap.ii.497, vs.27), he was called Vangīsa, both because he was born in Vaṅga and also because he was master of the spoken word (vacana).<br>See also Vangīsa Sutta andSubhāsita Sutta.'],

'vattagāmaṇī abhaya':['King of Ceylon (29 17 B.C.). He was the son of Saddhātissa, and came to the throne by killing the usurper Mahārattaka (v.l. Kammahārattaka).<br>He married Anulā, wife of Khallātanāga, and adopted Mahācūlika as his own son; because of this Vattagāmaṇī came to be known as Pitirājā (this name occurs several times in the Commentaries - e.g., VibhA. passim, see Pitirājā).<br>Vattagāmaṇī had a second wife, Somadevī, and also a son of his own, called Coranāga. In the fifth month of his reign a brahmin, named Tissa, rose against him, but was defeated by seven Damilas who landed at Mahātittha. . After that, the Damilas waged war against the king and defeated him at Kolambālaka. It was a remark made by the Nigantha Giri to Vattagāmainī, as he fled from the battle, that led later to the establishment of Abhayagiri (q.v.). The king hid in the forest in Vessagiri and was rescued by Kupikkala Mahātissa, who gave him over to the care of Tanasīva. In his flight he left Somadevī behind, and she was captured by the Damilas.<br>For fourteen years Vattagāmaṇī and his queen Anulā lived under the protection of Tanasīva, and, during this time, five Damilas ruled in succession at Anurādhapura; they were Pulahattha, Bāhiya, Panayamāra, Pilayamāra and Dāthika.<br>After a time, Anulā quarrelled with Tanasīva’s wife, and the king, in his resentment, killed Tanasīva. Later, when he also killed Kapisīsa, his ministers left him in disgust, but were persuaded by Mahātissa to return. When his preparations were complete, the king attacked Dāthika, slew him, and took the throne. He then founded Abhayagiri-vihāra and recovered Somadevī. He also built the Silāsobbhakaṇḍaka-cetiya. He had seven ministers who themselves built several vihāras; among them Uttiya, Mūla, Sāliya, Pabbata and Tissa are mentioned by name.<br>It was in the reign of Vattagāmaṇī that the Buddhist Canon and its Commentaries were first reduced to writing in Ceylon, according to tradition, in Aloka vihāra. For details of Vattagāmaṇī’s reign see Dpv.xx.14ff.; Mhv.xxxiii.34ff. The foundation of Abhayagiri vihāra formed the beginning of dissensions in the ranks of the monks (Cv.lxxiii.18). Vattagāmāni was, however, regarded by later generations as a great protector of the faith (Cv.lxxxii.23). Various monasteries, chiefly rock temples, are traditionally ascribed to Vattagāmaṇī, and said to have been built by him during his exile; among these is the modern Dambulla vihāra. The Cūlavamsa calls him the founder of the Majjhavela vihāra. Cv.c.229.'],
'vattaka jātaka':['1. Vattaka Jātaka (No. 35). The Bodhisatta was once born as a quail, and before he was old enough to fly, fire broke out in the forest wherein his nest was. Seeing no means of escape, he made an Act of Truth (sacca-kiriyā), calling to mind the holiness of the Buddhas and their doctrines. The fire retreated to a distance of sixteen lengths and then extinguished itself. The story was related in reference to a fire which broke out in the jungle when the Buddha was travelling in Magadha with a large company of monks. Some of the monks were frightened and suggested various methods for putting out the fire, while others said they should seek the Buddha’s protection. This they did and the Buddha took them to a certain spot, where he halted. The flames came no nearer than sixteen lengths from where they were standing, and in approaching the spot extinguished themselves. When the monks marvelled at the great power of the Buddha, he told them the story of the past and said that, owing to his Act of Truth as a quail, that spot would never be harmed by flames during the whole of this kappa. J.i.212ff.; cp.i.172.<br>2. Vattaka Jātaka (No. 118). The Bodhisatta was once born as a quail, and was caught by a fowler who sold birds after fattening them. The Bodhisatta, knowing this, starved himself, and when the fowler took him out of the cage to examine his condition the quail flew away and rejoined his companions.<br>The story was told in reference to a young man of Sāvatthi called Uttarasetthiputta. He had descended from the Brahma world and had no desire for women. Once, during the Kattika festival, his friends sent him a gaily decked woman to entice him, but he gave her some money and sent her away. As she came out of his house, a nobleman saw her and took her with him. When she failed to return, her mother complained to the king, and the setthiputta was told to restore her. On failing to do so, he was taken off for execution. He resolved that if by any means he could escape execution he would become a monk. The girl noticed the crowd following the young man, and on learning the reason she revealed her identity and he was set free. He, thereupon, joined the Order and soon after became an arahant. J.i.432ff.<br>3. Vattaka Jātaka (No. 394). The Bodhisatta was once a forest quail living on rough grass and seeds. A greedy crow of Benares, who was in the forest, saw the quail and thought that the good condition of his body was due to rich food. The quail, seeing the crow, talked to him, and then the crow discovered that the quail had a beautiful body not because he ate rich food, but because he had contentment of mind and freedom from fear.<br>The story was related in reference to a greedy monk who is identified with the crow. J.iii.312f.<br>4. Vattaka Jātaka. See also the Sammodamāna Jātaka, which is evidently also referred to as the Vattaka Jātaka. E.g., J.v.414; DhA.i.46; SNA.ii.358.'],

Distressed by the sight of their hatred for each other, he sought the help of the Buddha, who preached to him three stanzas (Thag.237-9). At the end of the recitation, Vārana developed insight and became an arahant.<br>Ninety two kappas ago he was born in the family of the brahmin Sumedha, and becoming expert in brahmin lore, he entered the ascetic life. As he sat teaching hymns to his pupils there was an earthquake, marking the conception of Tissa Buddha.

'vāruṇī jātaka':['The Bodhisatta once had a friend who was a tavern keeper. One day the tavern keeper made ready a supply of strong spirits and went to bathe, leaving his apprentice, Kondañña, in charge. The latter, who had seen customers send for salt and jagghery to make their drink more appetizing, pounded some salt and put it in the liquor, hoping to improve it.<br>The story was told in reference to a friend of Anāthapindika who was a tavern keeper, whose apprentice did likewise.

'vāsabbakkhattiyā':['Daughter of Mahānāma the Sākiyan by a slave-woman named Nāgamundā (J.i.133). When Pasenadi asked for a Sākiyan girl in marriage, she was given to him. Mahā-nāma went through the pretence of eating with her in order to allay Pasenadi’s suspicions. It is said (J.iv.145) that Mahā-nāma sat down to eat with her, but that as he was about to take the first mouthful, a messenger arrived, as prearranged, and brought him an urgent letter. He, thereupon, left the food uneaten in order to read the letter, and asked Vāsabhakkhattiyā to finish her meal.<br>Vidūdabha was the son of Vāsabhakkhattiyā. It was this deceit practised on Pasenadi which made Vidūdabha take his revenge on the Sākiyans (DhA.i.345 f; J.iv.145f).<br>It is said that when Pasenadi discovered Vāsabhakkhattiyā’s servile origin, he degraded both her and her son from their rank, and that they never went outside the palace (J.i.133f.; iv.148; aft also M.ii.110, where she is called Vāsabhā).<br>When the Buddha heard of this, he visited the king, preached to him the Katthahāri Jātaka, and had the queen restored to honour.'],

He again did so, when, at his next visit, the Buddha preached to him the Tevijja Sutta. Soon after, he entered the Order, and, at the conclusion of the preaching of the Aggañña Sutta, he was given the higher ordination and attained arahantship.

'vāseṭṭha sutta':['1. Vāsettha Sutta. The young brahmins, Vāsettha and Bhāradvāja, fell to discussing one day, at Icchānankala, as to what makes a true brahmin. Bhāradvāja maintained that it was pure descent from seven generations of ancestors, with neither break nor blemish in the lineage, whereas Vāsettha contended that virtue and moral behaviour made a true brahmin. As neither could convince the other, they agreed to refer the matter to the Buddha, who said it was not birth but deeds which made the true brahmin. M.ii.196ff. The sutta also occurs in SN., p.115ff.; many of the verses are included in the Brāhmana Vagga of the Dhammapada.<br>2. Vāsettha Sutta. The lay disciple Vāsettha visits the Buddha at theKūtāgārasālā inVesāli and states that it would be a good thing for them, for many a day, if his kinsmen, brahmins, trades folk, labourers, etc., kept the uposatha with the eightfold qualifications.

'vāsijata':['The āsavas are destroyed only by self training, not by merely wishing for their destruction. A hen may wish for her chicks to break through their eggs with foot, or claw, or mouth, or beak, but they will not do so till they are fully warmed, fully brooded over by the hen. When they are ready to break through, they will do so, irrespective of the hen’s wish.

Vāsudeva is addressed (J.iv.84; he is called Kanha at J.vi.421) as Kanha and again as Kesava. The scholiast explains (J.iv.84) that he is called Kanha because he belonged to the Kanhāyanagotta, and Kesava because he had beautiful hair (kesasobhanatāya). These names, however, give support to the theory (see Andhakaveṇhudāsaputtā, No.1) that the story of Vāsudeva was associated with the legend of Krsna.<br>In the Mahāummagga Jātaka (J.vi.421) it is stated that Jambāvatī, mother of King Sivi, was the consort of Vāsudeva Kanha. The scholiast identifies this Vāsudeva with the eldest of the Andhakaveṇhudāsaputtā, and says that Jambāvatī was a candalī.

'vāsuladattā':['Wife of Udena, king of Kosambī. She was the daughter of Candappajjota.<br>When Pajjota heard that Udena’s splendour surpassed his own, he resolved to capture him. He was told that Udena could charm elephants with his magic lute, and had a wooden elephant made in which he placed sixty men. A woodsman was sent to inform Udena of the new elephant which had appeared in the forest, and he set out to capture it. The men inside the elephant caused it to run, and, in the course of the chase, Udena was separated from his retinue and taken captive.<br>For three days Pajjota feasted in celebration of his victory, and Udena asked him either to release him or order his death. Pajjota promised release if Udena would teach him the elephant charm; but Udena would teach only to one who paid him homage as a teacher, and this Pajjota would not do. Then Pajjota contrived that Udena should teach it to Vāsuladattā. A curtain was hung between them, Udena was told that his pupil was a hunch backed woman of the court, while Udena was described to the princess as a leper who knew a priceless charm.<br>For many days Udena tried to teach the charm, but the princess could not learn it. In impatience, Udena said: ”Dunce of a hunchback, thy lips are too thick and thy cheeks too fat; I’ve a mind to beat thy face in.” And the princess replied: ”Villain of a leper, what meanest thou by calling me hunchback?” Udena lifted the fringe of the curtain and they saw each other. From that moment they planned to escape and marry. There was no more learning of charms nor giving of lessons. When their plans were complete, Vāsuladattā told her father that she needed a conveyance and the use of a gate in the city wall. To work the charm, she explained, a certain herb was necessary, which must be obtained at night, at a time indicated by the stars. Thus she secured the use of Pajjota’s female elephant, Bhaddavatī, and permission to use a certain door at any time.<br>And one day, when Pajjota was out on pleasure, the two filled several bags with gold and silver coins and they started off on Bhaddavatī. The harem guards gave the alarm and the king sent men in pursuit. Udena opened first a sack of gold and then one of silver, scattering the coins, which delayed his pursuers, greedy for the coins. He, meanwhile, hurried on and reached the stockade where his soldiers awaited him. They conducted him and Vāsuladattā, to Kosambī, where she was made Udena’s chief consort. DhA.i.191-6,198f.'],

But when the horse came, Kundalī, not wishing to make herself cheap, kicked him on the jaw and nearly killed him. The horse was ashamed and did not repeat his visit, and Kundalī died of love.<br>The story was told to a landowner of Sāvatthi, with whom a beautiful woman fell desperately in love.

The king marvelled that a vātamiga, who was so shy that if it once saw a man it would not visit the same place for a week after, should allow itself to be caught by greed.<br>The story was related in reference to Cullapindapātika Tissa (q.v.), who was enticed back to the lay life by a slave girl.

They were so called because when they took two prisoners they would keep one, sending the other for ransom.<br>These robbers kept the brahmin and sent the Bodhisatta for the ransom. The Bodhisatta, knowing that that night the conjunction of the stars would occur, which ensured the efficacy of the charm, warned the brahmin not to make use of it. But when night came the brahmin repeated the charm, and the robbers were so delighted that he was able to persuade them to set him free. They set off with the treasures that had fallen from the sky, the brahmin accompanying them, but on the way they were attacked by another robber band. These were told that the brahmin could make treasures fall from the sky; they were therefore set free, only the brahmin being kept back. But on being told that they must wait for one year for the necessary conjunction of planets, they were angry, cut the brahmin in two, and pursued the first band of robbers, destroying them entirely. Unable to agree on the division of the spoils which they thus obtained, the second band fought among themselves till only two were left. These took the treasure and hid it in a jungle near the village. One guarded it while the other went to the village for rice. When he returned he cooked the rice, ate his share, and put poison in the rest hoping thus to rid himself of his companion; the latter, however, killed him, then ate the rice and died himself. The Bodhisatta returning with the ransom, found all the dead bodies, in various places, and realized what had happened.

The mountain was bathed in radiance when Sakka visited the Buddha on the occasion of the preaching of the Sakkapañha Sutta (D.ii.263, 264).<br>Buddhaghosa says (DA.iii.697) that the mountain was so called because its base was covered with a forest belt, which looked like a jewel railing (manivedikā).<br>On the mountain lived an owl, who would accompany the Buddha half way to the village when he went for alms, and return with him. One day the owl stood with lowered wings, its claws clasped together.

'vejayanta':['1. Vejayanta. A pāsāda belonging to Sakka. When Moggallāna visited Sakka to discover if he had fully understood the Buddha’s teaching in the Cūlataṇhā saṅkhaya Sutta, Sakka tried to evade his questions by showing him this palace. It has one hundred towers, each seven stories high, with seven nymphs in each storey, waited on by seven attendants. The palace appeared inTāvatimsa on the day of Sakka’s decisive victory over the Asuras. Moggallāna allowed himself to be shown round, and then, with his big toe, he made the palace quake and rock.<br>M.i.252f.; cf. Thag. 1196f.; ThagA.ii.184. The palace was also made to rock by the novice Sangharakkhita (q.v.) on the day he joined the Order (DA.ii.558).<br>The palace is one thousand leagues high, and is so called because it arose in the hour of victory (J.i.203). It is decked with banners, each three hundred leagues long - banners of gold on jewelled staffs and vice versa; and the whole palace is built of the seven precious substances. It arose as the result of the rest house built by Sakka, in his birth as Magha, for the use of the multitude (DhA.i.273; cf. DA.iii.698). When the Buddha visitedTāvatimsa with Nanda, Sakka was in the palace with his crimson footed (kakutapādiniyo) nymphs and came forward with them to greet him. The nymphs had given oil for the massaging of Kassapa Buddha’s feet, hence the colour of their own feet. SNA.i.274.<br>When King Sādhīna ofMithilā went to Tāvatimsa, he lived, according to human computation, seven hundred years in Vejayanta (J.iv.357).<br>The Vejayantapāsāda is illustrated on the Bharhut Tope.

'vekhanassa sutta':['Vekhanassa visits the Buddha at Jetavana and argues about perfection. As in the Culla Sakuladāyī Suttas, the Buddha says that what Vekhanassa defines as perfection is merely a refinement of pleasure, and that only arahants can grasp the real meaning of perfection. Vekhanassa is annoyed, but the Buddha soothes him, and he becomes the Buddha’s follower (M.ii.40ff).<br>In the sutta Vekhanassa is called Kaccāna. The Commentary (MA.ii.716) says that Vekhanassa visited the Buddha because he wished to discover for himself why his favourite pupil, Sakuludāyī, should have been defeated by the Buddha; he, therefore, travelled all the way from Rājagaha to Sāvatthi, a distance of forty five leagues, to see the Buddha.'],

There, in due course, he became a famous teacher, with eighty four thousand princes among his pupils. Later, he became chaplain to the Benares king. Every year the eighty four thousand princes came to Benares to pay their respects to the king, causing great suffering to the people. These complained to the king, and he asked Velāma to find a way out of the difficulty. Velāma marked out eighty four thousand provinces for the princes, and, thereafter, they obtained their supplies from their respective dominions.<br>Velāma was exceedingly wealthy and wished to give alms. Therefore, turning his water jar upside down, he wished that if there were holy men in the world, the water should flow downwards. The water, however, remained in the jar. He then discovered by the same means that his gifts would be free from blame. He thereupon held great almsgivings, distributing during seven years the seven precious things and gifts of great value, pouring forth his riches as though ”making into one stream the five great rivers.”<br>A list of his gifts is found at A.IX.20.<br>Velāma’s story is given in AA.ii.802ff.; it is referred to in the Velāma Sutta and in the introductory story to the Khadirangāra Jātaka (No.40).<br>Velāma’s almsgiving became famous in literature as the Velāmamahāyañña.

'velāma sutta':['Anāthapindika loses all his wealth, and laments one day to the Buddha that he can only afford to give to the monks a coarse mixture of broken rice grains and sour gruel. The quality of the food is not important, says the Buddha, but only the heart of the giver, whether the giving is done casually or considerately and with devotion, and whether the recipients are worthy.<br>He then tells of the great gifts made by Velāma. Though the gifts were great, Velāma could find no holy persons as recipients. The Buddha then goes on to say that greater than the giving of alms, or even the building of monasteries, is the taking of the Refuges, the observance of good conduct, the practice of amity, and the thinking of impermanence, each of these being greater than the last.<br>(A.ix20; the sutta is referred to at DhA.iii.11; KhA.222; DA.i.234 VibhA.414).<br>It was on this occasion that the Khadirangāra Jātaka was preached.'],

'veluka jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once at the head of five hundred hermits, one of whom had a pet viper which was called Veluka, because it was kept in a bamboo.

One day the hermits went into the forest and were away for a few days, and when Velukapitā touched the viper on his return, the animal, hungry and angry, bit him, and he fell down dead.

SeeVelukantakī.<br>Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.717; SNA.i.370) that the city was so called because bamboos were thickly planted for protection round the walls and fortifications.'],
'velukantakī':['A lady of Velukanta (Velukanda). She is mentioned as an exemplary lay woman (A.i.88; ii.164). She founded, for the Order headed bySāriputta andMoggallāna an offering which the Buddha praised, because it was endowed with the six requisite qualities. SeeDāna Sutta (1).<br>Once she rose before dawn and sang the Parāyana.Vessavana happened to be passing over her house on his way from north to south (to see the Buddha, says SNA.i.369), and hearing the song, stopped at her window to praise it and to reveal his identity. She greeted him cordially, and in return for her greeting he announced to her that Sāriputta and Moggallāna were on their way to Velukanta. She, delighted with the news, made all preparations and sent word to the monastery, inviting the monks to the house. After the meal, she informed the Elders that Vessavana had told her of their arrival. When they expressed their amazement, she told them of several other virtues possessed by her. Her only son Nanda was seized by the king’s men and killed before her eyes, but she experienced no disquiet, nor did she when her husband, after his death, having been born as a Yakkha (Bhummadevatā says the Commentary), revealed himself to her. She was guilty of no transgression of the precepts, could enter into the four jhānas at will, and had cast off the five lower fetters. The monks expressed their great admiration and Sāriputta preached to her (A.iv.63ff).<br>Buddhaghosa says (AA.ii.718; cf. SNA.i.370) that she was an anāgāmī, and that, when she promised to share with Vessavana the merits she would gain by entertaining the monks, headed by the two Chief Disciples, Vessavana, to show his gratitude, filled her stores with rice, and these stores remained always full throughout her life. They thus became proverbial.<br>The Sutta Nipāta Commentary (SNA.i.370) states that she kept a daily fast and knew the Pitakas by heart. It also says that, at the end of her recital of the Parāyana, Vessavana offered her a boon, and she asked that, as her servants were weary of carrying the harvest home from the fields, Vessavana should allow his Yakkhas to do the work for them. To this he agreed, and his followers filled for her one thousand two hundred and fifty store houses. Vessavana then went to the Buddha and told him of what had happened.<br>The Dhammapada Commentary (DhA.i.340) mentions Velukantakī Nandamātā andKhujjattarā as the chief lay women disciples of the Buddha. But in the Anguttara list of eminent lay women, while Velukantakī Nandamātā’s name does not occur, Khujjatarā is mentioned. Mention is made of a Nandamātā, eminent in meditation, but she is calledUttarā.<br>A.i.26; cf. S.ii.236, where the same two are mentioned; Mrs. Rhys Davids thinks that Velukantakī Nandamātā is probably identical with Uttarā Nandamātā (Brethren 4, n.1).

When Velusumana grew up, he went to live with Sumana, governor of Girijanapada, and broke in a horse with which everyone else had failed. Sumana therefore gave him one hundred thousand and sent him to Kākavannatissa’s court (Mhv.xxiii.68ff).<br>When Vihāradevī wished to drink water in which had been washed the sword which cut off the head of Nandasārathi, Elāra’s chief warrior, Velusumana was entrusted with the task of killing Nandasārathi. He therefore went to Anurādhapura, where he became friendly with the keeper of the king’s state horse, Vāha. One day he took the horse to bathe in the Kadambanadī, and, after announcing his name, rode away on him. Elarā sent Nandasārathi in pursuit. Velusumana stood concealed behind a thicket, on a mound called Nigrodhasāla, with drawn sword, and as Nandasārathi rode past quickly, he was transfixed by Velusumana’s sword (Mhv.xxii.51ff.; MT. 440f).<br>Velusumana took a prominent part in the capture of Vijitapura (Mhv.xxv.25).

A country and its people. At the time of the Buddha, Videha formed one of the two important principalities of the Vajjian confederacy. Its capital was Mithilā. The kingdom bordered on the Ganges, on one side of which was Magadha and on the other Videha (See, e.g., M.i.225; MA.i.448). Adjacent to it were Kāsi and Kosala. In theGandhāra Jātaka (J.iii.365; iv. 316) the kingdom of Videha is said to have been three hundred leagues in extent, with sixteen thousand villages, well filled storehouses and sixteen thousand dancing girls. Videha was a great trade centre, and mention is made (PvA.227) of merchants coming from Sāvatthi to sell their wares in Videha.<br>The Suruci Jātaka seems to show that a close connection existed between Videha and Benares. In the Buddha’s time, one of Bimbisāra’s queens was probably from Videha (see Vedehiputta). Mention is also made (MA.i.534) of a friendship existing between the kings of Gandhāra and Videha. In earlier times Videha was evidently a kingdom, its best known kings being Mahājanaka and Nimi; but in the Buddha’s time it was a republic, part of the Vajjian federation. According to the Mahāgovinda Sutta (D.ii.235), it was KingRenu who, with the help of Mahāgovinda Jotipāla, founded the Videha kingdom. The Commentaries (E.g., DA.ii.482; MA.i.184) state that Videha was colonized by the inhabitants, who were brought from Pubbavideha by King Mandhātā.<br>The Satapatha Brāhmana (I.iv.1), however, ascribes the kingdom to Māthava the Videgha, and gives as its boundaries Kausikī in the east, the Ganges to the south, the Sadārūra in the west, and the Himālaya in the north. In the centre of Videha was Pabbatarattha, in which was the city Dhammakonda, the residence of Dhaniya. (SNA.i.26).<br>The strainer used by the Buddha was honoured, after his death, by the people of Videha (Bu.xxviii.11).<br>Uruvela Kassapa was, in a previous birth, king of Videha (Ap.ii.483).<br>3. Videha. The name of a king of Videha, the father of the Bodhisatta in the Vinīlaka Jātaka (q.v.). v.l. Vedeha.<br>4. Videha. A king of Videha who later became an ascetic.

'vidhura':['1. Vidhura. A brahmin, chaplain of the king of Benares. For details see the Sambhava Jātaka. He is identified with Mahā Kassapa (J.v.67). Vidhura’s son was Bhadrakāra. J.v.60.<br>2. Vidhura. The Bodhisatta born as the minister ofDhanañjaya-Korabba. See theVidhurapaṇḍita Jātaka.<br>His father was the brahmin Canda (J.vi.262), and he owned three palaces: Koñca, Mayūra and Piyaketa (J.vi.289).<br>Anujjā was his wife and Cetā his daughter in law; among his sons wasDhammapāla (J.vi.290).<br>In one place (J.vi.301) he is spoken of as having one thousand wives and seven hundred female slaves.<br>The Vidhurapaṇḍita of the Dhūmakāri Jātaka is probably identical with the above, as also the minister of the same name in the Dasabrāhmana Jātaka. The latter contains a long discussion between Vidhūra and the Korabba king regarding the qualities of a true brahmin.<br>3. Vidhura. The Milinda-Pañha (p.202) refers to a birth of the Bodhisatta in which he was a wise man (paṇḍita) named Vidhura.

The reference is evidently to the Sabbadātha Jātaka (No. 241), but there the Bodhisatta’s name is not given.<br>4. Vidhura. See also Vidhūra.'],
'vidhurapaṇḍita jātaka':['v.l.

They cannot decide among themselves and agree, therefore, to refer the matter to Dhanañjaya’s minister, Vidhurapaṇḍita (the Bodhisatta). The minister listens to the claims of each and then declares that all are equal; their virtues are like the spokes of a wheel. They are pleased, and Sakka gives the minister a silk robe, Varuṇa a jewel, the Supanna king a golden garland, and Dhanañjaya one thousand cows.<br>Vimalā, Varuṇa’s wife, hearing from her husband of Vidhura’s wisdom, is so enchanted that she yearns to see him, and in order to do so feigns illness, and says that she must have Vidhura’s heart. Varuṇa’s daughter, Irandatī, is offered to anyone who can get possession of Vidhura’s heart, and the YakkhaPunnaka, nephew of Vessavana, who sees her and is fascinated by her beauty, accepts the condition. He obtains Vessavana’s consent by a ruse and visits Dhanañjaya’s court. There he challenges the king to a game of dice, giving his name as Kaccāyana, and offers as stake his wonderful steed and all seeing gem, provided the king will offer Vidhura as his. Dhanañaya agrees, plays and loses.<br>Vidhura agrees to go with Punnaka; the king asks him questions regarding the householder’s life for his own guidance, and Vidhura is given three days’ leave to visit his family. Having taken leave of them, he goes with Punnaka. On the way Punnaka tries in vain to kill him by frightening him. When Vidhura discovers Punnaka’s intention, he preaches to him as he sits on the top of theKālapabbata, and the Yakkha is so moved that he offers to take Vidhura back to Indapatta. But in spite of his protestations, Vidhura insists on going on to the Nāga world. They arrive in Varuṇa’s abode; Vidhura preaches first to Varuṇa and then to Vimalā. They are both delighted, and Punnaka wins the hand of Irandatī. In his great joy Punnaka gives Vidhura his marvellous jewel and takes him back to Indapatta. There Vidhura relates his adventures and gives the jewel to the king. A festival lasting one month is held in honour of Vidhura’s return.<br>The story was related in reference to the Buddha’s wisdom. Vidhura’s chief wife, Anujjā, is identified withRāhulamātā; his eldest son,Dhammapāla, with Rāhula; Varuṇa with Sāriputta; the Supanna king with Moggallāna; Sakka with Anuruddha, and Dhanañjaya withAnanda (J.vi.255-329).<br>The Jātaka is also referred to as the Punnaka Jātaka (E.g., J.iv.14, 182).<br>Four scenes from the Jātaka are found on the Bharhut Tope.

Vikkamabāhu lived there with Mahānāgahula (Cv.lx.88f) as his capital. When Vijayabāhu died, some of Vikkamabāhu’s relations, Jayabāhu and the three sons of Mittā (Mānābharaṇa, Kittisirimegha and Sirivallabha) conspired to keep him out of the succession, but he defeated them in various battles and took possession of the capital Pulatthipura, losing, however, Dakkhinadesa and his former province of Rohana (Cv.lxi.2f). A year later his enemies again rose in revolt, led by Mānābharaṇa, and, as Vikkamabāhu advanced to Kalyanī to fight them, Vīradeva, of Palandīpa (q.v.) landed in Mannāra, and his attention was diverted. In the first engagements, Vikkamabāhu was defeated by Vīradeva and forced to flee to Kotthasāra, but Vīradeva was later defeated and slain at Antaravitthika. From then onwards Vikkamabāhu and the three sons of Mittā (see above) lived each in his province, but became unpopular both with the saṅgha and the laity owing to their greed and lust.

'vissakamma':['A deva, inhabitant of Tāvatimsa. He is the chief architect, designer and decorator among the devas, and Sakka asks for his services whenever necessary. Thus he was ordered to build the palace called Dhamma for Mahāsudassana (D.ii.180) and another for Mahāpanāda (J.iv.323; DA.iii.856).<br>He also built the hermitages for the Bodhisatta in various births - e.g., as<br>Sumedha (J.i.7) Kuddālapaṇḍita (J.i.314) Hatthipāla (J.iv.489) Ayoghara (J.iv.499) Jotipāla (J.v.132) Sutasoma (J.v.190) Temiya (J.vi.21, 29) Vessantara (J.vi.519f)Vissakamma also built the hermitage for Dukūlaka and Pārikā (J.vi.72).<br>On the day that the Buddha renounced the world, Sakka sent Vissakamma in the guise of a shampooer to bathe him and clothe him in his royal ornaments (J.i.60; DhA.i.70; BuA.232; he also constructed ponds in which the prince might bathe, AA.i.379); he also sent him to adorn Temiya on the day he left the kingdom (J.vi.12).<br>Vissakamma erected the jewelled pavilion, twelve leagues in compass, under the Gandamba, where the Buddha performed the Twin Miracle and built the three stairways of jewels, silver and gold, used by the Buddha in his descent from Tāvatimsa to Sankassa (J.iv.265f). He built, the pavilions in which the Buddha and five hundred arahants travelled to Uggapura, at the invitation of Culla Subhaddā. (DhA.iii.470; and again for the journey to Sunāpuranta, MA.ii.1017).<br>When Ajātasattu deposited his share of the Buddha’s relics in a thūpa, Sakka ordered Vissakamma to construct around the thūpa a vālasaṅghātayanta (revolving wheel?) to prevent anyone from approaching the relics. Later, when Dhammāsoka (Piyadassī) wished to obtain these relics for his vihāra, Vissakamma appeared before him in the guise of a village youth and, by shooting an arrow at the controlling screw of the machine, stopped its revolutions (DA.ii.613, 614).<br>He constructed the jewelled pavilion in which Sonuttara placed the relies he brought from the Nāga world till the time came for them to be deposited in the Mahā Thūpa, (Mhv.xxxi.76) and on the day of their enshrinement, Vissakamma, acting on Sakka’s orders, decorated the whole of Ceylon (Mhv.xxxi.34). He also provided the bricks used in the construction of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxviii.8). Sometimes he would enter into a workman’s body and inspire him with ideas - e.g., in designing the form of the Mahā Thūpa (Mhv.xxx.11). He was also responsible for the construction of the golden vase in which the branch of the Bodhi tree was conveyed to Ceylon (Mhv.xviii.24).<br>As in the case of Mātalī and Sakka, Vissakamma is evidently the name of an office and not a personal name. Thus, in the Suruci Jātaka (J.iv. 325), Vissakamma is mentioned as a previous birth of Ananda, while, according to the Dhammapada Commentary, the architect who helped Magha and his companions in their good works, was reborn as Vissakamma. DhA.i.272. The story given regarding Vissakamma in SNA.i.233, evidently refers to the Mahākaṇha Jātaka.

In reply to Pasenadi, the Buddha said he would perform the miracle at the foot of the Gandamba tree on the full moon day of Asāḷha \[in July\]. This was in the seventh year after the Enlightenment (DA.i.57).<br>The heretics therefore uprooted all mango trees for one league around, but, on the promised day, the Buddha went to the king’s garden, accepted the mango offered by Ganda, and caused a marvellous tree to sprout from its seed. The people, discovering what the heretics had done, attacked them, and they had to flee helter-skelter. It was during this flight that Pūrana Kassapa committed suicide. The multitude, assembled to witness the miracle, extended to a distance of thirty six leagues. The Buddha created a jewelled walk in the air by the side of the Gandamba. When the Buddha’s disciples knew what was in his mind, several of them offered to perform miracles and so refute the insinuations of the heretics. Among such disciples were Gharanī,Culla Anātthapindika,Cīrā, Cunda,Uppalavannā andMoggallāna.<br>The Buddha refused their offers and related theKanhausabha andNandivisāla Jātakas. Then, standing on the jewelled walk, he proceeded to perform the Yamaka-pātihāriya (Twin Miracle), so called because it consisted in the appearance of phenomena of opposite character in pairs - e.g., producing flames from the upper part of the body and a stream of water from the lower, and then alternatively. Flames of fire and streams of water also proceeded alternatively from the right side of his body and from the left. DA.l.57; DhA.iii.214f. explains how this was done. From every pore of his body rays of six colours darted forth, upwards to the realm of Brahmā and downwards to the edge of the Cakkavāla. The Miracle lasted for a long while, and as the Buddha walked up and down the jewelled terrace he preached to the multitude from time to time. It is said that he performed miracles and preached sermons during sixteen days, according to the various dispositions of those present in the assembly. At the conclusion of the Miracle, the Buddha, following the example of his predecessors, made his way, in three strides, to Tāvatimsa, there to preach the Abhidhamma Pitaka to his mother, now born as a devaputta.<br>The Twin Miracle is described at DA.i.57, and in very great detail at DhA.iii.204; see also J.iv.263ff. The DhA. version appears to be entirely different from the Jātaka version; the latter is very brief and lacks many details, especially regarding Pindoḷa’s miracle and the preaching of the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa. The account given in Dvy. (143-66) is again different; the Miracle was evidently repeatedly performed by the Buddha (see, e.g., Candanamālā), and it is often referred to - e.g., J.i.77, 88, 193; Ps.i.125; SNA.i.36; AA.i.71; MA.ii.962; Mil. 349; Vsm.390; PvA.137; Dāthāvamsa i.50. The miracle was also performed by the Buddha’s relics; see, .e.g., Mhv.xvii.52f.; Sp.i.88, 92.<br>It is said (Mil.349) that two hundred millions of beings penetrated to an understanding of the Dhamma at the conclusion of the Miracle.<br>The Twin Miracle can only be performed by the Buddha.

'yamaka sutta':['The Thera Yamaka held the view that, in so far as a monk has destroyed the āsavas, he is broken up and perishes at the break up of the body and becomes not after death. Yamaka’s colleagues tried to correct this erroneous view (the heresy lies in the implication that ”a being is broken up and perishes”; SA.ii.226.) but failed, and so reported him to Sāriputta. Sāriputta visited Yamaka and argued with him that if it were false to say of anybody that he existed in truth, in reality, even in this very life, how much more so to speak of someone existing or not existing after death. Yamaka thereupon confessed his error. Sāriputta further elucidated the matter by using the simile of a man who enters the service of a rich householder with the intent to murder him. Such a man would always be a murderer, even though his master knew him not to be so. Even so, the disciple who regards body, etc., as permanent and so on, harbours a murderous view, even though he knows it not as such (S.iii.109ff).<br>The sutta is often referred to. (E.g., VibhA.32; Vsm.479; cp. Vsm.626 (Yamakato sammasana). Does Yamakato here mean ”according to the Yamaka Sutta”?).<br>It is sometimes called the Yamakovāda Sutta (E.g., Netti, p. 30).'],

'yasoja':['He was born outside the gates of Sāvatthi in a fishing village, where his father was the headman of five hundred families. When he came of age, he was fishing one day in the Aciravatī, and, casting his net, caught a large golden colour fish. Yasoja and his companions took the fish to Pasenadi who sent them to the Buddha. The Buddha told them that the fish had been a wicked monk in the time of Kassapa Buddha, and had since suffered in purgatory, where his mother and sisters still were. He then preached to them the Kapila Sutta, and Yasoja and his companions, greatly moved, renounced the world (ThagA.i.356f.).<br>The Udāna mentions (Ud.iii.3) how, later, Yasoja and five hundred of his companions went to see the Buddha at Jetavana. There they stood talking to the monks who lived there and made a great uproar. The Buddha, sending Ananda to fetch them, asked them to remove themselves from his presence, as they were behaving like fishermen. Taking his admonition to heart, they returned to the banks of the Vaggumudā in the Vajji country, and there they determined to lead such lives as would commend them to the Buddha. During the rainy season, they all put forth effort and attained arahantship. Some time after, the Buddha visited Vesāli during a journey and asked Amanda to send for Yasoja and his friends as he desired to see them. Ananda sent a message. When the monks arrived, they found the Buddha lost in meditation, and they, too, seated themselves and entered into samādhi, remaining thus throughout the night. Amanda could not understand why the Buddha, having sent for Yasoja and his companions, should have sunk into samādhi without greeting them, and three times during the night he tried to remind the Buddha of their arrival; but the Buddha ignored his warnings and in the morning explained to him that it was more joy for them all to live in the bliss of samādhi than to indulge in mere conversation. It is said in UdA.185 that the Buddha spent the night in samādhi in order to show Yasoja and his companions that he regarded them as equals.<br>It is said (ThagA.i.357) that when Yasoja and the others visited the Buddha at Vesāli, they were very thin and had grown uncomely through their austerities. The Buddha commended their self denial in a verse, and Yasoja, appreciating the Buddha’s praise, uttered two other verses, exalting the love of solitude (Thag.243 5).<br>In the time of Vipassī Buddha Yasoja belonged to a family of park-keepers (ārāmagopakā), and one day seeing the Buddha travel through the air, he gave him a labuja fruit (ThagA.i.356). In the time of Kassapa Buddha, Yasoja was the leader of a band of five hundred robbers. They were pursued by the villagers and fled into the forest for safety. There they saw a monk sitting on a stone and asked him for protection. He advised them to take the five precepts, and when they had done so, he exhorted them never to violate these precepts even if keeping them meant the loss of their lives. Soon after, they were captured and killed. But remembering the monk’s admonition at the moment of death, they harboured no hatred against anyone, and after death were reborn in the deva world (UdA.179f).<br>The Vinaya relates (Vin.i.239) how once, when Yasoja was ill, drugs were brought for his use, but as the Buddha had forbidden the use of a special place for storing such things (kappiyabhūmi) they were left out of doors and were partly eaten by vermin, the remainder being carried away by robbers. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he allowed the use of a duly chosen kappiyabhūmi. The Apadāna verses ascribed to Yasoja in the Theragāthā are, in the Apadāna itself, found in two places: one under Labujadāyaka (Ap.ii.409) and the other, with slight variations, under Labujaphaladāyaka.

Son of Sabbadatta, king of Ramma, and younger brother of the Bodhisatta, born as Yuvañjaya. He is identified with Ananda. See the Yuvañjaya Jātaka.<br>3. Yudhitthila. The name of a gotta to which Dhanañjaya, king of the Kurus, belonged (J.iii.400; v. 59, etc.). Mention is made also of a Koravyarājā of the Yudhitthilagotta (J.iv.361). Probably the kings of the Kurus belonged mostly to a dynasty that claimed its descent from Yudhitthila (Yudhisthira?).'],
'yuganaddha':['Ananda tells the monks at Ghositārāma, in Kosambī, that those who have attained arahantship have done so in one of four ways: Kosambī<br>by developing insight preceded by calm, or calm preceded by insight, or calm and insight together, or by having a mind utterly devoid of perplexities about the Dhamma. A.ii.157.'],

'yugandhara':['1. Yugandhara. One of the mountains of the Himālaya (J.i.119, 232; iv.213; vi.125; DhA.i.249; Vsm.206). It forms the first of the seven ranges round Sineru (SNA, ii.443; but according to J.vi.125 it is the fourth range).<br>A Yugandharasāgara (e.g., J.i.64; vi.43) is also sometimes mentioned, and was probably a sea between Yugandhara and the next mountain range. When the Buddha reached Tāvatimsa in three strides, his first stride was from the earth to Yugandhara (DhA.iii.216).<br>It was on the summit of Yugandhara that Assagutta convened an assembly of the monks in order to discuss their plan of campaign against Milinda (Mil.p.6). The sun is mentioned as first rising over Yugandhara (E.g., SA.ii.165), hence the expression “Like the morning sun over Yugandhara.” E.g. PvA.137.<br>2. Yugandhara.-One of the chief Yakkhas to be invoked by the Buddha’s followers in time of need. D.iii.205'],
'yuvañjaya jātaka':['The Bodhisatta was once born as Yuvañjaya, son of Sabbadatta, king of Ramma (Benares). He was the eldest of one thousand sons, and Yuditthila was his younger brother. After he came of age he was on his way early one morning to the park, and saw all around him dew. In the evening, as he returned home, the dew drops were no more to be seen. His charioteer explained that the sun had dried them up. Reflecting on this, the prince realized the impermanence of life and asked his father’s leave to renounce the world.<br>Both his parents tried to dissuade him but they failed, and he and Yudhitthila built a hermitage in the Himālaya, where they became ascetics.<br>Yudhitthila is identified with Ananda. This story was told in reference to the Buddha’s Renunciation, to some monks who marvelled at the Buddha’s great sacrifice. J.iv.119ff.; the story of Yuvañjaya (Yudhañjaya) is also given in the Cariyāpitaka iii.1; CypA.143ff.'],
'yūthikapupphiya':['1. Yūthikapupphiya Thera. An arahant. Ninety four kappas ago he saw the Buddha (?Siddhattha) on the banks of the Candabhāgā, and offered him a yūthika (jasmine) flower.
