The Story of King Mahāvijita’s Sacrifice<br>Then Kūṭadanta together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him.<br>When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side.<br>Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Khāṇumataka bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent.<br>Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha,<br>“Master Gotama, I’ve heard that<br>you know how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.<br>I don’t know about that,<br>but I wish to perform a great sacrifice.<br>Please teach me how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.”<br>“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.”<br>“Yes sir,” Kūṭadanta replied.<br>The Buddha said this:<br>Once upon a time, brahmin, there was a king named Mahāvijita. He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses.<br>Then as King Mahāvijita was in private retreat this thought came to his mind:<br>‘I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I hold a large sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’<br>Then he summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him:<br>‘Just now, brahmin, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind,<br>“I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I perform a great sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”<br>Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice.<br>Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’<br>When he had spoken, the brahmin high priest said to him:<br>‘Sir, the king’s realm is harried and oppressed. Bandits have been seen raiding villages, towns, and cities, and infesting the highways.<br>But if the king were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and oppressed, he would not be doing his duty.<br>Now the king might think,<br>“I’ll eradicate this barbarian obstacle by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment!” But that’s not the right way to eradicate this barbarian obstacle.<br>Those who remain after the killing will return to harass the king’s realm.<br>Rather, here is a plan, relying on which the barbarian obstacle will be properly uprooted.<br>So let the king provide seed and fodder for those in the realm who work in farming and raising cattle.<br>Let the king provide funding for those who work in trade.<br>Let the king guarantee food and wages for those in government service.<br>Then the people, occupied with their own work, will not harass the realm.<br>The king’s revenues will be great.<br>When the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, will dwell as if their houses were wide open.’<br>The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation.<br>Then the king summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him:<br>‘I have eradicated the barbarian obstacle. And relying on your plan my revenue is now great.<br>Since the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, dwell as if their houses were wide open.<br>Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice.<br>Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’<br>4.1. The Four Accessories<br>‘In that case, let the king announce this throughout the realm to the aristocrat vassals, ministers and counselors, well-to-do brahmins, and well-off householders, both of town and country:<br>“I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please grant your approval, gentlemen; it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.”<br>The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation.<br>And all of the people who were thus informed responded by saying:<br>‘May the king perform a sacrifice! It is time for a sacrifice, great king.’<br>And so these four consenting factions became accessories to the sacrifice.<br>4.2. The Eight Accessories<br>King Mahāvijita possessed eight factors.<br>He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation.<br>He was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He was magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold.<br>He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses.<br>He was powerful, having an army of four divisions that was obedient and carried out instructions. He’d probably prevail over his enemies just with his reputation.<br>He was faithful, generous, a donor, his door always open. He was a well-spring of support, making merit with ascetics and brahmins, for paupers, vagrants, travelers, and beggars.<br>He was very learned in diverse fields of learning. He understood the meaning of diverse statements, saying:<br>‘This is what that statement means; that is what this statement means.’<br>He was astute, competent, and intelligent, able to think issues through as they bear upon the past, future, and present.<br>These are the eight factors that King Mahāvijita possessed.<br>And so these eight factors also became accessories to the sacrifice.<br>4.3. Four More Accessories<br>And the brahmin high priest had four factors.<br>He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation.<br>He recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.<br>He was ethical, mature in ethical conduct.<br>He was astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle.<br>These are the four factors that the brahmin high priest possessed.<br>And so these four factors also became accessories to the sacrifice.<br>4.4. The Three Modes";
M_QUE[ 614] = "“I shall lose a great fortune,” or<br>“I am losing a great fortune,” or<br>“I have lost a great fortune.” But the king should not harbor such regrets.’<br>These are the three modes that the brahmin high priest taught to the king before the sacrifice.<br>4.5. The Ten Respects";
M_QUE[ 616] = "As to those who kill living creatures, the outcome of that is theirs alone.<br>But as to those who refrain from killing living creatures, it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.<br>There will come to the sacrifice those who steal …<br>commit sexual misconduct …<br>lie …<br>use divisive speech …<br>use harsh speech …<br>talk nonsense …<br>are covetous …<br>have ill will …<br>have wrong view and those who have right view.<br>As to those who have wrong view, the outcome of that is theirs alone.<br>But as to those who have right view, it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.’<br>These are the ten respects in which the high priest dispelled the king’s regret regarding the recipients before the sacrifice.<br>4.6. The Sixteen Respects";
M_QUE[ 654] = "“Hooray for such sacrifice! Hooray for the accomplishment of such sacrifice!”<br>But the brahmin Kūṭadanta sat in silence.<br>So those brahmins said to him,<br>“How can you not applaud the ascetic Gotama’s fine words?”<br>“It’s not that I don’t applaud what he said.<br>If anyone didn’t applaud such fine words, their head would explode!<br>But, gentlemen, it occurs to me that<br>the ascetic Gotama does not say:<br>‘So I have heard’ or ‘It ought to be like this.’<br>Rather, he just says:<br>‘So it was then, this is how it was then.’<br>It occurs to me that<br>the ascetic Gotama at that time must have been King Mahāvijita, the owner of the sacrifice, or else the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice for him.<br>Does Master Gotama recall having performed such a sacrifice, or having facilitated it, and then, when his body broke up, after death, being reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?”<br>“I do recall that, brahmin. For at that time I was the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice.”<br>5. A Regular Gift as an Ongoing Family Sacrifice.<br>“But Master Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories, is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”<br>“There is, brahmin.”<br>“But what is it?”<br>“The regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates;<br>this sacrifice, brahmin, has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial.”<br>“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings, yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories?”<br>“Because neither perfected ones nor those who have entered the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice.<br>Why is that?<br>Because beatings and throttlings are seen there.<br>But the regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates;<br>perfected ones and those who have entered the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice.<br>Why is that?<br>Because no beatings and throttlings are seen there.<br>This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings, yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories.”<br>“But Master Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories and those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice, is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”<br>“There is, brahmin.”<br>“But what is it?”<br>“When someone gives a dwelling specially for the Saṅgha of the four quarters.”<br>“But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”<br>“When someone with confident heart goes for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.”<br>“But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”<br>“When someone with a confident heart undertakes the training rules<br>to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.”<br>“But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?”<br>“There is, brahmin.<br>It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …<br>That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. …<br>They enter and remain in the first absorption …<br>This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. …<br>They enter and remain in the second absorption …<br>third absorption …<br>fourth absorption.<br>This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. …<br>They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision …<br>This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial.<br>They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’<br>This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial.<br>And, brahmin, there is no other accomplishment of sacrifice which is better and finer than this.”<br>6. Kūṭadanta Declares Himself a Lay Follower<br>When he had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha,<br>“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!<br>As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.<br>I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.<br>From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.<br>And these bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams—seven hundred of each—I release them, I grant them life!

M_QUE[ 660] = "Then Kūṭadanta served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.<br>When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Kūṭadanta took a low seat and sat to one side.<br>Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left.";

He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita,<br>“Sir, Kassapa, these several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha, and also Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis, have come here to see the Buddha. It’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.”<br>“Well then, Sīha, tell the Buddha yourself.”<br>“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha. He went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of the people waiting to see him, adding:<br>“Sir, it’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.”<br>“Well then, Sīha, spread out a seat in the shade of the dwelling.”<br>“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha, and he did so.<br>Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and sat in the shade of the dwelling on the seat spread out.<br>Then the brahmin emissaries went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him.<br>When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side.<br>Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side.

Perception and the Self<br>“Sir, is perception a person’s self, or are perception and self different things?”<br>“But Poṭṭhapāda, do you believe in a self?”<br>“I believe in a substantial self, sir, which is physical, made up of the four primary elements, and consumes solid food.”<br>“Suppose there were such a substantial self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another.<br>Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things.<br>So long as that substantial self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease.<br>That is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.”<br>“Sir, I believe in a mind-made self which is complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty.”<br>“Suppose there were such a mind-made self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another.<br>Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things.<br>So long as that mind-made self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease.<br>That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.”<br>“Sir, I believe in a non-physical self which is made of perception.”<br>“Suppose there were such a non-physical self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another.<br>Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things.<br>So long as that non-physical self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease.<br>That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.”<br>“But, sir, am I able to know whether<br>perception is a person’s self, or whether perception and self are different things?”<br>“It’s hard for you to understand this, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition.”<br>“Well, if that’s the case, sir,<br>then is this right: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?”<br>“This has not been declared by me, Poṭṭhapāda.”<br>“Then is this right: ‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?”<br>“This too has not been declared by me.”<br>“Then is this right: ‘The cosmos is finite …’ …<br>‘The cosmos is infinite …’ …<br>‘The soul and the body are the same thing …’ …<br>‘The soul and the body are different things …’ …<br>‘A Realized One exists after death …’ …<br>‘A Realized One doesn’t exist after death …’ …<br>‘A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death …’ …<br>‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?”<br>“This too has not been declared by me.”<br>“Why haven’t these things been declared by the Buddha?”<br>“Because they’re not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.<br>That’s why I haven’t declared them.”<br>“Then what has been declared by the Buddha?”<br>“I have declared this: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.”<br>“Why have these things been declared by the Buddha?”<br>“Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.

When someone reprimands such a teacher, the reprimand is false, baseless, illegitimate, and blameworthy.”<br>When he had spoken, Lohicca said to the Buddha:<br>“Suppose, Master Gotama, a person was on the verge of falling off a cliff, and another person were to grab them by the hair, pull them up, and place them on firm ground.<br>In the same way, when I was falling off a cliff Master Gotama pulled me up and placed me on safe ground.<br>Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent!<br>As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways.<br>I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha.<br>From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”";
