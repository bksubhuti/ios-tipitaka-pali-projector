Six Drawbacks of Roaming the Streets at Night<br>There are these six drawbacks of roaming the streets at night.<br>Yourself, your partners and children, and your property are all left unguarded. You’re suspected of bad deeds. Untrue rumors spread about you. You’re at the forefront of many things that entail suffering.<br>These are the six drawbacks of roaming the streets at night.<br>7. Six Drawbacks of Festivals<br>There are these six drawbacks of frequenting festivals.<br>You’re always thinking: ‘Where’s the dancing? Where’s the singing? Where’s the music? Where are the stories? Where’s the applause? Where are the kettle-drums?’<br>These are the six drawbacks of frequenting festivals.<br>8. Six Drawbacks of Gambling<br>There are these six drawbacks of habitually gambling.<br>Victory breeds enmity. The loser mourns their money. There is immediate loss of wealth. A gambler’s word carries no weight in public assembly. Friends and colleagues treat them with contempt. And no-one wants to marry a gambler, for they think:<br>‘This individual is a gambler—they’re not able to support a partner.’<br>These are the six drawbacks of habitually gambling.<br>9. Six Drawbacks of Bad Friends<br>There are these six drawbacks of bad friends.<br>You become friends and companions with those who are scoundrels, drunkards, addicts, frauds, swindlers, and thugs.<br>These are the six drawbacks of bad friends.<br>10. Six Drawbacks of Laziness<br>There are these six drawbacks of habitual laziness.<br>You don’t get your work done because you think: ‘It’s too cold! It’s too hot. It’s too late! It’s too early! I’m too hungry! I’m too full!’<br>By dwelling on so many excuses for not working, you don’t make any more money, and the money you already have runs out.<br>These are the six drawbacks of habitual laziness.”<br>That is what the Buddha said.<br>Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:<br>“Some are just drinking buddies,<br>some call you their dear, dear friend,<br>but a true friend is one<br>who stands by you in need.<br>Sleeping late, adultery,<br>making enemies, harmfulness,<br>bad friends, and avarice:<br>these six grounds ruin a person.<br>With bad friends, bad companions,<br>bad behavior and alms-resort,<br>a man falls to ruin<br>in both this world and the next.<br>Dice, women, drink, song and dance;<br>sleeping by day and roaming at night;<br>bad friends, and avarice:<br>these six grounds ruin a person.<br>They play dice and drink liquor,<br>and consort with women loved by others.<br>Associating with the worse, not the better,<br>they diminish like the waning moon.<br>A drunkard, broke, and destitute,<br>thirsty, drinking in the bar,<br>drowning in debt,<br>will quickly lose their way.<br>When you’re in the habit of sleeping late,<br>seeing night as time to rise,<br>and always getting drunk,<br>you can’t keep up the household life.<br>‘Too cold, too hot,<br>too late,’ they say.<br>When the young neglect their work like this,<br>riches pass them by.<br>But one who considers hot and cold<br>as nothing more than blades of grass—<br>he does his manly duty,<br>and happiness never fails.”<br>11.

They’re hospitable in the future. They’re full of meaningless pleasantries.

They praise you to your face, and put you down behind your back.<br>You can recognize a fake friend who’s a flatterer on these four grounds.<br>You can recognize a fake friend who’s a spender on four grounds.<br>They accompany you when drinking, roaming the streets at night, frequenting festivals, and gambling.<br>You can recognize a fake friend who’s a spender on these four grounds.”<br>That is what the Buddha said.<br>Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:<br>“One friend is all take,<br>another all talk;<br>one’s just a flatterer,<br>and one’s a friend who spends.<br>An astute person understands<br>these four enemies for what they are<br>and keeps them at a distance,<br>as they’d shun a risky road.”<br>12. Good-Hearted Friends<br>“Householder’s son, you should recognize these four good-hearted friends:<br>the helper, the friend in good times and bad, the counselor, and the one who’s compassionate.<br>You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s a helper on four grounds.<br>They guard you when you’re negligent. They guard your property when you’re negligent. They keep you safe in times of danger. When something needs doing, they supply you with twice the money you need.<br>You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s a helper on these four grounds.<br>You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s the same in good times and bad on four grounds.<br>They tell you secrets. They keep your secrets. They don’t abandon you in times of trouble. They’d even give their life for you.<br>You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s the same in good times and bad on these four grounds.<br>You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s a counselor on four grounds.<br>They keep you from doing bad. They support you in doing good. They teach you what you do not know. They explain the path to heaven.<br>You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s a counselor on these four grounds.<br>You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s compassionate on four grounds.<br>They don’t delight in your misfortune. They delight in your good fortune. They keep others from criticizing you. They encourage praise of you.<br>You can recognize a good-hearted friend who’s compassionate on these four grounds.”<br>That is what the Buddha said.<br>Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:<br>“A friend who’s a helper,<br>one the same in both pleasure and pain,<br>a friend of good counsel,<br>and one of compassion;<br>an astute person understands<br>these four friends for what they are<br>and carefully looks after them,<br>like a mother the child at her breast.<br>The astute and virtuous<br>shine like a burning flame.<br>They pick up riches as bees<br>roaming round pick up pollen.<br>And their riches proceed to grow,<br>like an ant-hill piling up.<br>In gathering wealth like this,<br>a householder does enough for their family.<br>And they’d hold on to friends<br>by dividing their wealth in four.<br>One portion is to enjoy.<br>Two parts invest in work.<br>And the fourth should be kept<br>for times of trouble.”<br>13. Covering the Six Quarters<br>“And how, householder’s son, does a noble disciple cover the six quarters?<br>These six quarters should be recognized:<br>parents as the east, teachers as the south, partner and children as the west, friends and colleagues as the north, bondservants and workers as beneath, and ascetics and brahmins as above.<br>A child should serve their parents as the eastern quarter in five ways, thinking:<br>‘I will support those who supported me. I’ll do my duty for them. I’ll maintain the family traditions. I’ll take care of the inheritance. When they have passed away, I’ll make an offering on their behalf.’<br>Parents served by the children in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways.<br>They keep them from doing bad. They support them in doing good. They train them in a profession. They connect them with a suitable partner. They transfer the inheritance in due time.<br>Parents served by their children in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways.<br>And that’s how the eastern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.<br>A student should serve their teacher as the southern quarter in five ways:<br>by rising for them, by serving them, by listening well, by looking after them, and by carefully learning their profession.<br>Teachers served by their students in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways.<br>They make sure they’re well trained and well educated. They clearly explain all the knowledge of the profession. They introduce them to their friends and colleagues. They provide protection in every region.<br>Teachers served by their students in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways.<br>And that’s how the southern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.<br>A husband should serve his wife as the western quarter in five ways:<br>by treating her with honor, by not looking down on her, by not being unfaithful, by relinquishing authority to her, and by presenting her with adornments.<br>A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows compassion to him in five ways.<br>She’s well-organized in her work. She manages the domestic help. She’s not unfaithful. She preserves his earnings. She’s deft and tireless in all her duties.<br>A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows compassion to him in these five ways.<br>And that’s how the western quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.<br>A gentleman should serve their friends and colleagues as the northern quarter in five ways:<br>giving, kindly words, taking care, equality, and not using tricky words.<br>Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways.<br>They guard them when they’re negligent. They guard their property when they’re negligent. They keep them safe in times of danger. They don’t abandon them in times of trouble. They honor their descendants.<br>Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways.<br>And that’s how the northern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.<br>A master should serve their bondservants and workers as the lower quarter in five ways:<br>by organizing work according to ability, by paying food and wages, by nursing them when sick, by sharing special treats, and by giving time off work.<br>Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways.<br>They get up first, and go to bed last. They don’t steal. They do their work well. And they promote a good reputation.<br>Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways.<br>And that’s how the lower quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.<br>A gentleman should serve ascetics and brahmins as the upper quarter in five ways:<br>by loving deeds of body, speech, and mind, by not turning them away at the gate, and by providing them with material needs.<br>Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways.<br>They keep them from doing bad. They support them in doing good. They think of them with kindly thoughts. They teach them what they do not know. They clarify what they’ve already learned. They explain the path to heaven.<br>Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways.<br>And that’s how the upper quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.”<br>That is what the Buddha said.<br>Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:<br>“Parents are the east,";
